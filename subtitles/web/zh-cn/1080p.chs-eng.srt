1
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,250
（序幕）

2
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,750
（极北之地 1857年）

3
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,700
船长！
Captain!

4
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,830
船长！
Captain!

5
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,500
能聊聊吗？
Can we talk?

6
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,500
嗯
Hmm.

7
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,580
我们必须破冰前行
We must break through the ice.

8
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,040
大家都很饿 也累坏了
The men are hungry and exhausted.

9
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,620
要是继续这样下去 恐怕会付出代价
We cannot keep up this pace without consequence.

10
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,580
大家听着！
Listen up, men!

11
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:32,700
我们拖得越久 冰就冻得越牢固
The more we delay the labor, the firmer the grasp of the ice will become.

12
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,750
继续干活
The work continues.

13
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,700
各组轮流作业
Rotate each group.

14
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:37,950
先生 请听我说
Sir, with respect…

15
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,910
大家需要一句准话
The men need assurances.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,950
准话？
Assurances?

17
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,790
对 就是让船动起来之后 我们会回圣彼得堡去
Yes, that we will head back to St. Petersburg once we free the ship.

18
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,580
他们觉得我们的船航行不了多久了 他们想知道…
They don't think we'll be seaworthy for long and they want to know--

19
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,080
都听好了！
Listen up!

20
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:55,870
别的任何事情 都不是你们和这位长官该考虑的
It is neither your place, nor the officer here, to think anything…

21
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,120
我们接受了一项任务 就要把它完成
We signed up for a mission and we will see it to completion.

22
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,750
我们一定会到达北极
We will reach the North Pole.

23
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,450
都听明白了吗？
Is it understood?

24
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,330
船长 那里爆炸了…
An explosion, Captain.

25
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,080
离这里大约三公里
About two miles away.

26
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,080
去救人
Get the men.

27
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,910
雪橇犬没受伤
The sled dogs are unharmed.

28
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,120
那这血是哪来的？
Then where does all this blood come from?

29
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,620
船长 在那里！
Over here, Captain!

30
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,450
有个受了伤的人 他流了好多血
A wounded man, he's lost a lot of blood.

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,910
肩膀受伤了 腿断了
Wound to the shoulder, his leg is broken.

32
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,200
是被熊咬的吗？
Bear attack?

33
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,870
我觉得不是 船长
I don't think so, Captain.

34
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,700
拉森 来帮我把这只靴子脱下来
Larsen, help me with his boot.

35
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,950
是个假肢
A prosthetic leg.

36
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,330
把他抬船上去
Put him on the board.

37
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,450
快 抬上船 赶紧！
Hurry! To the ship! Now!

38
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,620
拉森 那东西来了
Larsen, that thing is coming.

39
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,540
步枪准备！
Ready the rifles!

40
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,950
听我指令
On my command.

41
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,700
瞄准！
Aim!

42
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,160
开火！
Fire!

43
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,910
下一组！
Next group!

44
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,500
开火！
Fire!

45
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,450
全部上船！
All to the ship!!

46
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,040
我们抬上船的那个人呢？
Where is that man we brought onboard?

47
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,950
他在哪里？
Where?

48
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,580
那究竟是什么东西？它想干什么？
What is that thing? What does it want?

49
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,660
把他给我！
Bring him to me!

50
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,750
喇叭枪 拉森 拿喇叭枪！
The blunderbuss. Larsen, get the blunderbuss!

51
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,410
维克多
Victor.

52
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,160
维克多！
Victor!

53
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,870
我杀了它
I killed it.

54
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,500
我杀了它
I killed it.

55
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,000
它还活着！
It's still alive!

56
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,200
梯子！
Ladder!

57
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,620
快收梯子！
Pull up the ladder!

58
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,580
把他交出来！
Bring him to me!

59
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,540
还剩几发？
How many shots are left?

60
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,080
一发 但杀不了它
One, but it can't kill it.

61
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,700
我知道
I know.

62
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,870
我也不是要打他
I'm not aiming for him.

63
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,790
这是鸦片酊 能止痛 喝吧
Laudanum, to ease the pain. Drink it. Drink it.

64
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,540
我这是在哪里？
Where am I?

65
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,330
这是丹麦皇家航船霍莱松特号
You are on the Royal Danish ship, Horisont.

66
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,250
我是安德森船长 这位是邬德森医生
I'm Captain Anderson. This is Dr. Udsen.

67
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,370
那怪物杀了你们多少人？
How many of your men did it kill?

68
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,750
六个
Six.

69
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,200
它会回来 让更多人丧命
It will come back and kill many more.

70
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,750
要是不把我交出去 你们都会没命
All of you, if necessary, unless you deliver me to it.

71
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,450
不会的 它不在了
No, no. It's gone.

72
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,410
它沉入了冰水 死了
It sank in the freezing waters. It's dead.

73
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,120
它没死！
No, it is not!

74
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,830
它死不了
It cannot die.

75
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,160
我一直尝试彻底摧毁它
I have tried to destroy it.

76
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,410
不管你们信不信
Whether you believe me or not,

77
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,200
它都会回来 找我
it will come back… for me.

78
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,120
等它真的回来了
And when it does,

79
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,660
一定要把我送到外面的冰面上
you must promise that you will put me out on the ice

80
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,910
让它带走我
and let it take me.

81
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,120
求你们了
Please.

82
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,620
那究竟是什么？
What manner of creature is that?

83
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,870
是什么样的魔鬼造出来的？
What manner of devil made him?

84
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,000
是我
I did.

85
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,950
就是我
I did.

86
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,500
是我亲手造的他
I made him.

87
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:32,370
我本已下定决心 让那些罪恶的记忆和我一同消亡
I had determined that the memory of my evils should die with me.

88
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,160
准备好了
It's ready.

89
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,580
接下来我要说的话 有些是真的
Some of what I will tell you is fact.

90
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,580
有些是假的 但这是真的
Some is not, but it is all true.

91
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,790
我叫维克多
My name is Victor.

92
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,790
维克多·弗兰肯斯坦
Victor Frankenstein.

93
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,000
我的名字是父亲起的
It was my father who gave me that name.

94
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,330
你知道这名字是什么意思吗？
Do you know what it means?

95
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,790
应该是征服者的意思
I believe I do, yes. Conqueror.

96
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,750
赢得一切的人
One that wins it all.

97
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,870
没错 一切因他而起
Yes. It all started with him.

98
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,370
我的父亲
My father.

99
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,330
还有我的母亲
And my mother.

100
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,450
维克多！
Victor!

101
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,580
（第一部分 维克多的故事）

102
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,500
维克多！
Victor!

103
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,250
维克多！
Victor!

104
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,830
快下来 你父亲来了
Come down, your father is arriving.

105
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,750
Maman?
Maman?

106
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,370
母亲 我在这里
I'm here, Mother.

107
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,120
这里
I'm here.

108
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,410
我父亲是男爵 也是个杰出的外科医生
My father was a baron and a preeminent surgeon.

109
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,660
他娶我母亲 很大程度上为了利益
He had married my mother largely out of convenience,

110
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,750
因为母亲的陪嫁相当丰厚 而且她是贵族出身
as her dowry was considerable and her lineage noble.

111
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:53,200
她带来的资金 足以让父亲维持爵位和家族产业
It furnished my father with the means to preserve his rank and family estate.

112
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,000
日常生活中 从来看不见父亲的身影
He was absent from our lives,

113
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,000
而每当他回到家 所有人都对他唯命是从
but when he came home, the entire household bent to his will.

114
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,660
亲爱的克莱尔
Claire, dear.

115
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,370
他不在的时候…
The rest of the time…

116
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,160
维克多
Victor.

117
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,250
父亲
Father.

118
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,500
他不在的时候 母亲就是我一个人的
The rest of the time, Mother was mine.

119
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,540
别拿走 端到这里来
No, bring that here.

120
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,160
肉里的盐分能滋养你的血液
The salts in the meat will enrich your blood,

121
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,540
还有胎儿的
as well as the baby's.

122
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,790
一人吃 两人补 记得吗？
You eat for two, remember?

123
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,950
吃吧
Go on.

124
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,120
很有营养
It's nutritious.

125
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,500
守护天使
Guardian angel.

126
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,500
甜蜜的陪伴
Sweet companion.

127
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,410
请守护我 不要离开我
Stand by my side and do not leave me.

128
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,160
用你的披风庇护我 然后…
Under your mantle, shelter me, and…

129
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,700
我隔着墙听到他们争论不休
I would hear them through the wall, arguing incessantly,

130
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,620
对着彼此大吼大叫 话题关于财富和庄园 还有我
yelling at each other about wealth, estate… and me.

131
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,330
他们的争吵声让我万分恐惧
Their voices filled me with fear.

132
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,080
Maman?
Maman?

133
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,200
Maman?
Maman?

134
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,200
那个男人鄙视我们两个
The man despised us both.

135
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:52,120
讨厌我们乌黑的头发、深色的瞳孔
Our raven black hair, our deep, dark eyes.

136
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,790
就连我们喜好安静、不时紧张的性情
Even our quiet, at times nervous disposition

137
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,580
似乎也会让他大为光火
seemed to exasperate him to no end.

138
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:05,000
古代把体液分为哪几类？
List as accurately as you can the ancient classification

139
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,370
尽量说精确一点
of the humors in the human body.

140
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:11,700
血液、黑胆汁、黄胆汁和黏液
Blood, black bile, yellow bile, and phlegm.

141
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,200
男性心脏的平均重量是多少？

142
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,830
250到310克 父亲
Nine to eleven ounces, Father.

143
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,950
女性心脏的平均重量？
Average female heart. Weight?

144
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,410
230到280克
Eight to ten ounces.

145
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,870
你为什么觉得
Why do you suppose that is?

146
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,750
女性的心脏会轻一点？
Difference in mass in female heart?

147
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,660
是因为她们情感更强烈？
Depth of emotion?

148
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,950
更容易忧郁吗？
Tendency to the melancholic?

149
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,500
因为质量 血流量 肌肉灌注的不同 父亲
Mass. Volume of blood, Father. Muscular irrigation.

150
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,330
没错 人体组织中没有精神物质
Quite. There is no spiritual content in tissue,

151
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,290
肌肉中没有情感
and no emotion in a muscle.

152
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,790
那么 请描述一下三尖瓣的主要功能
Now, describe the main function of the tricuspid valve, please.

153
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,750
我现在想不起来了 父亲 但我肯定能想起来
I cannot recall, Father, but I'm sure I will remember.

154
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,250
嗯 我相信你
Yeah, I'm sure you will.

155
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,000
象牙不会流血 维克多
Ivory does not bleed, Victor.

156
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,330
但人体会
Flesh does.

157
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,330
等你想起了某个知识要点 恐怕你的病人已经一命呜呼了
By the time you remember a fact, your patient could be dead.

158
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,790
懂了吗？
You understand?

159
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,330
三尖瓣的主要功能
The main function of the tricuspid valve

160
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,910
是防止血液反流至腔静脉
is to prevent the reflux of blood into the vena cava.

161
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,910
不打手了 再也不打了
No, not your hands. Not anymore.

162
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,580
它们如今是你施展技艺的工具 是你意志的延伸
They are now the instruments of your craft and will,

163
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,040
要好好保护
and we must care for them.

164
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,660
而你的脸 就微不足道了
Your face, however, is vanity.

165
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:46,830
维克多 你沿用了我的名字 也必然要维护我的名声
You bear my name, Victor, and with it my reputation.

166
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,500
我恳请你牢记这一点
I pray you remember that.

167
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,580
我感觉你有很好的牌
I feel you have something very good, parce que…

168
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,080
三
Three…

169
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,410
二
Two…

170
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,370
一
One…

171
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,700
不可能
That's impossible.

172
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,450
我来洗牌
I'll shuffle.

173
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,450
母亲？
Mother?

174
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,000
Maman?\Maman?

175
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,950
父亲
Father!

176
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,450
父亲 母亲出事了
Father. It's Mother.

177
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,700
Maman.\Maman.

178
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,540
准备好热水和干净的亚麻布 多拿一点 快
I need hot water and clean linen. A lot of it.

179
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,450
是 先生
-Now. -Sir.

180
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,540
-不 维克多 -妈妈？
-No, Victor! -Mother?

181
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,500
-Maman! -维克多!
-Maman! -Victor!

182
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,870
父亲！
Father! Father!

183
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,410
一定要救她 求你了！
-Victor! -Save her, please!

184
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:41,120
我的母亲 我曾将她视作我的一部分
My mother, whom I had come to consider a part of my very self,

185
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,500
我曾以为她永远不会离去
she who I thought would never leave,

186
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:49,330
以为她是我的生命 如今她死了
she who was life… was now death.

187
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,830
她的双眼已暗淡无光
Her eyes extinguished,

188
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:57,040
笑容被冰冷的土地埋葬
her smile feeding the cold earth.

189
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
走开！
Leave!

190
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,200
都给我走开！
All of you, leave!

191
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,950
我的世界空了一块
A part of the universe had been hollowed out

192
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,830
我的头顶笼罩着永远的黑暗
and the firmament was now permanently dark.

193
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,040
遮住眼睛
Now, cover your eyes.

194
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,790
我叫你看再看哦
Don't look until I tell you to.

195
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,620
看吧
Now.

196
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,790
威廉在阳光和笑容中长大
William grew full of sunshine and smiles.

197
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:41,540
他的性情比我平和温顺 显然更讨父亲喜欢
He was of a calmer, gentler disposition, clearly favored by my father.

198
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,660
谢谢你 父亲
Thank you, Father.

199
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,410
不客气 儿子
Oh, it's a pleasure, my boy.

200
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,580
他是宜人的微风 我是滚滚的黑云
He was the breeze, I was the storm cloud.

201
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,870
他带来欢声笑语 我让人愁眉不展
He was all laughter, I was all frowns.

202
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,000
拿起缰绳
Pick up the reins.

203
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,370
父亲 看我做得怎么样
Look at me, Father. Look at me.

204
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,450
不止如此
There was something more.

205
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,290
更确切地说 某些东西被忽视了
Or rather, something was missing.

206
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,080
我的母亲
My mother had died

207
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,620
死在如日中天的名医
at the hands of the most distinguished doctor of his day:

208
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,870
我的父亲手下
My father.

209
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,700
我的脑中渐渐有了个想法
An idea… took shape in my mind.

210
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,450
请说说《心血运动论》中…
Define the circulatory system, if you will…

211
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,620
无可避免 无法逃避
Inevitable, unavoidable…

212
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,200
…对循环系统是怎么定义的
…as enunciated in De Motu Cordis.

213
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,040
…直到这个想法被说了出来
…until it became truth.

214
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,450
父亲？
Father?

215
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,950
你没救她 对吗？
You let her die, did you not?

216
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,120
我用尽全力救她了 你必须知道这一点
I did everything in my power to save her. You must know that.

217
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,410
这么说 你失败了
So you failed.

218
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,620
没人能战胜死亡
-No one can conquer death. -Mm-hmm.

219
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,540
我能 我会战胜的
I will. I will conquer it.

220
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,330
我会掌握你掌握的所有知识 还会更进一步
Everything you know, I will know. And more.

221
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,120
今天就到此为止吧
I think we've done quite enough for today.

222
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,160
那晚我重生了
I was born anew that night.

223
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,290
我看到了幻象
I had a vision.

224
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,540
我第一次看到了
I saw, for the first time…

225
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,830
黑暗天使
the Dark Angel.

226
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,410
它向我许下承诺
And it made me a promise.

227
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,790
我将能掌控生死
I would have command over the forces of life and death.

228
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,250
成为和父亲一样杰出的外科医生
I would become every ounce the surgeon my father was.

229
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,500
我的野心和成就将超过他
I would surpass him in ambition and in reach.

230
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,870
守护天使…

231
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,910
幻象如此清晰
The vision was so clear.

232
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,290
无论清醒还是睡梦中 我都从未看到如此清晰的景象
Clearer than anything I'd ever seen in my waking hours or dreams.

233
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:55,870
但承诺如何兑现？
But how?

234
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,200
我的境遇很快一落千丈
My downfall was swift.

235
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,950
母亲的种植园 经历了两次叛乱和一场火灾
Two revolts and a fire on my mother's plantations

236
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,620
家族财富因此锐减
dwindled the family fortune.

237
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:31,200
庄园留下了 但别的全都没了
We kept the estate, but lost everything else.

238
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,580
威廉被送去了维也纳的亲戚家
William went to one side of the family in Vienna

239
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,910
我去了伦敦 然后又去了爱丁堡
and I to London, then Edinburgh.

240
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,620
在那里 我花了数十年时间
And there, for decades, I tried to…

241
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:02,120
尝试为狭隘的学术界拓宽边界
expand the narrow limits of academia.

242
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,000
生命
Life.

243
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:10,500
这就是生命 先生们
This… is life, gentlemen.

244
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,700
（皇家医学院纪律法庭 1855年）

245
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,950
我们出生了
We are born.

246
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,500
嗯?
Hmm?

247
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,410
刚上去没多久 就掉下来了
And no sooner do we rise, we fall.

248
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,500
死了
Death.

249
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,910
这一起一落之间
And in the space between that rise and fall,

250
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,830
就是我们渺小卑微的一生
our humble little purview.

251
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,870
出生不为我们所控
Now, birth is not in our hands.

252
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
对不对？
Is it?

253
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:40,000
生命之火的点燃 思想和灵魂的诞生
Conception, that spark, the animation of thought and soul.

254
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,370
掌握在上帝的手中
That is in God's hands.

255
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,250
上帝
God.

256
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,410
而死亡
But death.

257
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,660
挑战正在此处
Ah, now there lies the challenge.

258
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,950
死亡应该掌握在我们手中
That should be our concern.

259
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,370
应该如此
It should be.

260
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,790
我们凭什么能掌控？ 我们又不是神明 对不对？
Who are we to do so? We are not gods, are we?

261
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:02,660
但要是我们能像神明那般大胆
But if we are to behave as immodestly as gods,

262
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,620
那至少能够创造奇迹
we must, at the very least, deliver miracles.

263
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,250
是不是？
Wouldn't you say?

264
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:12,450
在年轻学子心中点燃神圣火花
Ignite a divine spark…in these young students' minds.

265
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,700
教导他们抛弃顺从 违抗权威
Teach them defiance rather than obedience.

266
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:21,450
展示人类有可能掌控自然奥秘 让死亡不再发生
Show that man may pursue nature to her hiding places and stop death.

267
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,450
不是延缓死亡 而是长生不老！
Not slow it down, but stop it entirely!

268
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,370
安静！
Silence. Silence!

269
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:42,330
这种不可能的事 你究竟要怎么教？
How exactly do you propose to teach what is impossible?

270
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,160
人类的尸体 一个复合实体
Composite subject, the body.

271
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,370
这是某个店老板 刚咽气没多久就送到了我这里
That of a shopkeeper, delivered mere moments after expiration.

272
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,540
大脑暴露在外 但仍能运作
The brain laid bare but functional,

273
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,160
脊神经分支和迷走神经完好无损
the spinal branches and vagal nerves intact.

274
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,040
大家或许能看到一些极细的伤口
You may observe the hair-thin scars.

275
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,750
我的手艺无需粗糙的缝合
No coarse stitching needed by my own technique.

276
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,000
看这条手臂
The arm, you see,

277
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,620
来自某个木匠
comes from another specimen, that of a carpenter.

278
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,830
肌肉、韧带、神经 都已连结好
The muscles, ligaments, nerves, all connected now.

279
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,040
看啊 电流导致躯体痉挛
Now, the spasmodic movement of the body

280
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,120
这已不是新鲜事
caused from the electric current, this is not new.

281
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,700
大家都见过 不过 这种躯体内的能量流动
It's not new. However, the flow of energy through the body

282
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,370
遵循一种完全不同的概念
follows a different notion entirely.

283
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,290
一种称为气的东方概念
An Eastern notion called qi.

284
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:45,120
这种概念认为 生命能量的流动 同时存在于身体内外
Now, it considers the vital flow of energy both within and without.

285
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,870
我用针在六个…
I'm utilizing needles in six--

286
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:51,040
安静！都坐下！
Quiet! Sit down!

287
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:56,040
医生 这是听证会 不是狂欢节表演
This is a hearing, Doctor, not a carnival act.

288
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,080
你这样无济于事 维克多
You're not helping your cause, Victor.

289
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,750
这种用电的诡计根本没用
This galvanic trickery will simply not do.

290
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,830
诡计
Trickery.

291
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,750
诡计？
Trickery?

292
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,160
你确定吗？
Are you sure?

293
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,750
这不是诡计 而是一种抉择
That is not trickery. That is a decision.

294
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:20,160
一个死人的眼睛 和另一个死人的胳膊协调运动
Motor coordination between the eye of one dead man and the arm of another,

295
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,790
注入全新的意志和基本的理解力
infused with a new will and the rudiments of understanding.

296
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,500
已经死亡的大脑也有理解力吗？
Understanding in a brain that already died?

297
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,660
放开
Release now.

298
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,870
请放开
Please.

299
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,660
礼貌一点总有效果
"Please" always helps.

300
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,160
赶紧关了吧 你个江湖骗子
Turn that off at once. At once, you charlatan.

301
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,120
这就是未来 这是有可能实现的
This is the future. This is possible.

302
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,290
为什么不研究一下 量化一下呢？
Why not study it? Why not quantify it?

303
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:50,660
这是罪恶的 可恨、下流！
This is unholy. An abomination. An obscenity!

304
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,910
生命由上帝赐予 由上帝收回 维克多
God gives life, and God takes it, Victor.

305
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,500
或许上帝就是无能！
Perhaps God is inept!

306
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,330
要由我们来纠正他的错误！
And it is we that must amend his mistakes!

307
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,950
别让这些老蠢货阻止你自由表达！
Do not let these old fools extinguish your voice!

308
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,410
只有采取不盲从的态度 摆脱恐惧和恃强凌弱的教条
The answers only come when coaxed by disobedience,

309
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,410
答案才会浮现！
free of fear and cowardly dogma!

310
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,160
克伦佩教授
Professor Krempe.

311
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,870
弗兰肯斯坦男爵 我叫海因里希·哈兰德
Baron Frankenstein, my name is Heinrich Harlander,

312
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:08,700
我这里有一封
and I carry with me a letter of introduction

313
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,160
你的弟弟威廉写的介绍信
from your brother, William.

314
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,200
我弟弟？
From my brother?

315
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,660
我希望能有幸认识你
I asked for the privilege of your acquaintance.

316
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,620
耽误你一点时间
It won't take but a minute of your time.

317
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,870
-请进 -好
-Please. -Very well.

318
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,700
这么说 威廉要来看我 对吗？
So William is coming to see me, is that it?

319
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,160
对 几天后到
Yeah, in a matter of days.

320
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:29,120
他想让你见见他的未婚妻 也就是我的侄女
He wants to introduce you to his fiancée. My niece, as it happens.

321
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:36,200
她叫伊丽莎白·哈兰德 是一位非常可爱的小姐
Elizabeth Harlander, a very nice young lady,

322
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,540
刚刚从修道院学校毕业
fresh from convent life.

323
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,410
这些照片都是我拍的
The photographs are mine.

324
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:43,040
威廉在金融领域很有成就
William has become quite successful in the world of finance.

325
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,830
弗兰肯斯坦的名声越来越响了
He's making a name for himself.

326
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,000
哎哟！是吗？
Ha! A name? For himself?

327
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:52,540
要知道我们都是弗兰肯斯坦 不管我们乐不乐意
Well, I'm afraid we both share that name, whether we like it or not.

328
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,830
我拜读了你在《柳叶刀》上的文章
I read your article in The Lancet.

329
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,160
你真的觉得这事能做到吗？
You really believe you can do it?

330
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,370
组装出一个人来？
Assemble a man?

331
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,450
做出完整的全新人体？还要有生命？
A full new body? And give it life?

332
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,200
你今天也看到了
You saw it today, didn't you?

333
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,620
说真的 我看到的是你当众受难
What I saw was a crucifixion, really.

334
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,330
你还没开口说句话 就被钉死了
You were done for before you uttered a word.

335
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,750
但我还是向他们展示了
I still showed them.

336
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:14,700
展示什么？
What?

337
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,620
事实
The truth.

338
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,080
他们到晚餐时间就忘了
They will forget by suppertime.

339
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,950
话虽如此 你觉得怎么样？
Yes, yes, yes. But what did you think? Hmm?

340
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,620
我觉得非常厉害
I thought it was brilliant.

341
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,160
没错 我就知道
It was. I know.

342
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:31,040
但你有点孩子气 太激动了
But you are like a child, so excited,

343
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,200
紧抓你的新宠物 快把它勒死了
clutching your new pet so tightly that you're strangling it.

344
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,450
我不免为你担心
That is why I worry about you.

345
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,160
你能控制好火种吗 普罗米修斯？
Can you contain your fire, Prometheus?

346
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,120
还是没等把它交出去 就先烧伤了自己的手？
Or are you going to burn your hands before delivering it?

347
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,410
说得对
Quite.

348
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:51,910
请不要觉得我无礼 但这一天已经足够漫长
Please do not think me rude, but my day has proven long enough,

349
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,040
我的状态也完全不适合 再陪伴陌生人了
and I believe myself totally unfit for the company of strangers.

350
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,620
如果没有什么别的事了…
So if there's nothing more--

351
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,620
还有重要的事
Oh, but there is. Much more.

352
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,660
我在爱丁堡找好了住处
I've taken quarters in Edinburgh.

353
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,160
三天后 我们一起见威廉和伊丽莎白
Three days from now, we are to meet with William and Elizabeth.

354
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,370
我将在那晚改变你的命运
And that evening, I will change your destiny.

355
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,000
我会让你看到非同凡响的东西
I will show you something extraordinary.

356
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,500
-你真好 -谢谢 给

357
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:35,160
桃子 把桃子转过来
The peach. The peach. Turn the peach. Turn it.

358
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,330
你又啃了
You bit it again.

359
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,830
你一直在吃桃
You're eating the peaches.

360
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,330
这是对死亡的沉思
This is a memento mori.

361
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:49,410
桃子是生命和青春的符号 怎么就被你啃了？
The peach, symbol of life and youth, and you bite into it?

362
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,700
-我饿了呀 小希 -别那样叫我
-I was hungry, Kiki. -Don't call me Kiki.

363
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,660
先生 维克多·弗兰肯斯坦男爵来了
Baron Victor Frankenstein, sir.

364
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,910
你可以下去了
You can leave.

365
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,750
抱歉
Forgive me.

366
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,200
欢迎
Welcome.

367
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,250
哈兰德先生
Herr Harlander.

368
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,870
这是一种新兴艺术 摄影
A young art, photography.

369
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,330
再见 小希
Goodbye, Kiki.

370
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,160
我已经迷上了
Already a passion of mine.

371
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,080
文件都带来了吗？
Did you bring the papers?

372
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,580
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

373
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,370
-你非常出色 -谢谢
-You're extraordinary. -Thank you.

374
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,540
嗯
Hmm.

375
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:27,620
你利用神经系统来传递能量脉冲
You're using the nervous system to deliver the surge of energy.

376
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,660
对吗？
Are you not?

377
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,910
没错
Correct.

378
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
因此 你所操控的生命力 只能维持很短时间
And thus the sustainability of the life force you command

379
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,370
很快就会衰退、消散
is very brief, wanes, evaporates.

380
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
为什么这么说？
How so?

381
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,620
当时你颇为自豪地结束了演示
At the lecture, you ended your demonstration out of pride.

382
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,660
但其实是因为 那股电流般的生命力
But really, because the galvanic life force

383
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,500
已经衰竭了 对吗？
was already fading, was it not?

384
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,200
先生 你是外科医生吗？
Are you yourself a surgeon, sir?

385
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,040
曾经是 我是战地医生
Yeah, once upon a time. An army surgeon.

386
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,700
医术也说不上多精湛
Not a particularly skilled one, either.

387
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:05,950
但也给我打下了发家致富的基础
But it allowed me to secure the rudiments of my fortune.

388
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,950
我现在有几家军火工厂
I own a few ammunition factories.

389
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,870
-你是军火商 -不如说是个务实的
-An arms merchant. -A realist.

390
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,330
你对伊夫林解剖图表熟悉吗？
Are you familiar with the Evelyn Tables?

391
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,950
当然 那是约翰·伊夫林爵士当年
Of course. Acquired by Sir John Evelyn,

392
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,000
买下的四张人体标本精细解剖图
there are four planks, meticulous dissection,

393
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,120
是欧洲最早的人体神经 和动静脉解剖图
some of the oldest in Europe, presenting the nerves,

394
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,080
为什么会提到这个？
veins and arteries of cadavers. What?

395
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,000
因为还有第五张
Yes. But there's a fifth one.

396
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,290
这张最让人信服
The most compelling one.

397
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,000
非常细致 是不是？
Exquisite, is it not?

398
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,580
呈现于木头上的鲜活血肉
Flesh rendered onto wood.

399
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:41,580
尸体放在木板上 逐层剥离
The cadaver lies on the plank, is peeled away layer by layer,

400
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:45,370
用树脂将剩下的组织固定在木板上
and the remaining tissue is lacquered with resin onto the wood.

401
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:48,750
-这是淋巴系统 -没错
-It showcases the lymphatic system. -Yes.

402
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:52,620
穆斯林医学家称其为隐秘的循环系统
Muslim medics called it the secret circulatory system.

403
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:58,200
仅仅输送三升体液 却构成了庞大的网络
It moves a mere three liters of fluid, but it's a vast network.

404
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,000
-真是非同凡响 -确实
-Oh, it's remarkable. -Yes.

405
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,160
现在对我们 也是对你而言 关键的改变就在这里
Now for us, for you, the important variation is here.

406
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:10,290
这第九种构造 环绕心脏的结构
The ninth configuration. A very delicate,

407
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:13,750
极为精巧 近乎空灵
almost ethereal structure surrounding the heart.

408
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,120
既能分配能量 也能储存能量
It can distribute, but also store energy.

409
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:23,250
如果你能在不破坏周围组织的前提下
Yes, if you can access that without destroying

410
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,870
-触达这一构造… -不 不是前面
-the surrounding tissue-- -No. Not through the front.

411
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,250
是后面 脊柱 胸曲
The back, spinal column, thoracic curvature.

412
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:30,830
没错
Of course.

413
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:36,330
远超人们想象的能量流动 瘢痕形成和组织再生
Flow of energy, scarring and regeneration beyond anyone's imagination.

414
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,700
永生
Life eternal.

415
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,040
我将提供无限的资源 来支持你的研究
I will endow your pursuit with unlimited resources.

416
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,250
那我要拿什么来交换？
And in exchange?

417
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,200
这么说就俗了
No need to become indelicate.

418
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,750
我们探寻真理 志在超越 有着共同的追求
We're searchers for truth and transcendence, kindred spirits.

419
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,370
某天我也许会请你帮个忙 作为回报
I may in time ask you for a favor in return,

420
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:02,450
但最重要的是记录研究过程 以传诸后世的这份特权
but it's mostly the privilege to record your process for posterity.

421
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,660
我习惯独自工作
I work alone.

422
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,160
我绝对不出声
I'm very quiet.

423
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,250
哈兰德先生 威廉·弗兰肯斯坦和您的侄女到了
William Frankenstein and your niece, Herr Harlander.

424
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,200
我要考虑一下
I shall consider it.

425
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,620
我会考虑的
I'll consider it.

426
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:18,910
男爵
Baron.

427
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,200
别假装冷静了 错过了就可惜了
Don't pretend to be reasonable now. It would be such a shame.

428
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,950
维克多
Victor.

429
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,160
威廉！
William!

430
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,700
-维克多 -瞧瞧你
-Victor. -Look at you.

431
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,620
老天 你长大了
My, you've grown.

432
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,200
可惜不是我的功劳
Through no merit of my own.

433
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,040
来见见我的未婚妻吧
May I introduce the woman I'm to marry.

434
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,250
伊丽莎白·哈兰德小姐
Lady Elizabeth Harlander.

435
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,450
荣幸之至
Absolutely delighted.

436
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,250
听到你被驱逐 说实话我也不惊讶
Can't say I was shocked when you were expelled,

437
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:22,450
但他们的态度太强硬 言语太狠毒
but the manner and virulence of your expulsion,

438
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,700
我认为实在没有必要
uncalled for, I'm sure.

439
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,910
有必要
No, it was called for.

440
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
我应得的
I earned it.

441
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,000
我特意挣来的 你说是不是 哈兰德先生？
I made it a point to earn it, wouldn't you say, Herr Harlander?

442
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,660
确实声势浩大
It was quite an exit, I assure you.

443
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,410
为什么要激怒他们？
Why provoke them?

444
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,410
何不继续做自己的事 避免惹来不必要的关注？
Why not just carry on without calling attention to yourself in such a manner?

445
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:41,120
威廉 就算以你的标准来看 这么做也太保守了
How safe, even by your standards, William.

446
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,250
你这话听着都有点像父亲了
You almost sound like Father.

447
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:47,120
父亲可是相当老练的
He was a most tactful man, our father.

448
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,830
他做事精准、谨慎、有分寸感
He was precise, discreet, measured.

449
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:55,370
我就不是 我完全不懂为何谦虚是一种美德
I, on the other hand, fail to see why modesty is considered a virtue at all.

450
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,750
维克多一直这么引人注目
Victor's always been one to harvest attention.

451
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:01,620
即便在小时候 我也常常 通过保持沉默 来消解他的声音
Even as children, I mitigated his voice by staying silent.

452
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,580
这样的事发生无数次了吧 维克多 你说呢？
Perhaps too much and far too many times, wouldn't you say, Victor?

453
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,410
如果可以再造生命
If life can be regenerated,

454
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,200
并非简单的模拟
not as a mere simulation,

455
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:12,200
而是通过物理化学手段 如神迹般地再造 何不大声说出来？
but as a divine act by physical, chemical means, why whisper it?

456
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,870
你笑了？
You laugh?

457
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,700
-你觉得好笑吗？ -没错
-You're amused? -I must be, yes.

458
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,120
我的理念没表达清楚吗？
Are my ideas not clear?

459
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,660
你显然已经够大声的了
You certainly expressed them loudly enough.

460
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,000
不值得为之努力吗？
Are they not worthwhile?

461
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,830
我认为理念本身并不值得为之努力
Ideas are not worthwhile by themselves, I don't believe.

462
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,660
愿闻其详
Enlighten me, please.

463
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,370
拿战争来说
Take the war, for example.

464
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:37,080
威廉 去书房享用雪茄和白兰地吧
William, cigar and brandy in my study?

465
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:41,200
我侄女的长篇大论你肯定都听过了
Surely you've heard my niece expound on the matter before.

466
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:43,450
我们失陪了
You'll excuse us.

467
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:50,500
请继续说 关于理念
Pray, carry on. Ideas.

468
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:57,330
这么说吧 荣耀、国家、勇气
Well… honor, country, valor.

469
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,700
这些必然是值得为之奋斗的崇高理念
These surely are worthwhile, elevated ideas by themselves,

470
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,750
同意吧？
wouldn't you agree?

471
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:06,370
然而 人们为了这些理念赴死
-Mm-hmm. -And nevertheless, men are dying for them.

472
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,950
以一种显然毫不崇高的方式
In a decidedly un-elevated way,

473
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,910
脸埋在泥泞里 喉咙呛着血
face down in the mud, choking on blood,

474
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,200
痛得大喊大叫
screaming in pain.

475
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,370
他们是某人的父亲、兄弟或儿子
Men that were fathers, brothers or sons to someone out there.

476
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,370
他们被自己的母亲带到这个世界
Men that were fed, cleaned and nursed

477
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,330
被悉心喂养、洗净、照料、教育
and schooled into this world by their mothers,

478
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,870
最后却被送到某个遥远的战场
only to fall on a battlefield far away,

479
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,160
真正制造惨剧的人却躲得远远的
far from those that provoke these tragedies.

480
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:31,290
他们好好地待在家中 不沾血 不挨刀
Those men remain at home, untouched by blood or bayonet,

481
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:35,450
皮肤完好无损 被窝温暖洁净
their skin unpierced, their blankets warm and clean.

482
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,870
这就是蠢人追求理念的后果
That is what happens when ideas are pursued by fools.

483
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,700
那你觉得我是蠢人
And you think me a fool?

484
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,370
嗯?
Hmm?

485
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,910
快享用你的白兰地和雪茄去吧
Run to your brandy and cigars.

486
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,910
他们都在等着呢
The boys are waiting.

487
00:35:56,330 --> 00:36:01,160
一个人常常以为遇见了天使或魔鬼
How often a man believes he's met an angel or a devil,

488
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,910
到头来却发现一切不过是幻觉
only to find it is all an illusion.

489
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,500
我们下的这盘棋
The game of chess we play…

490
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:12,750
对手只有自己
we play only against ourselves.

491
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,000
帮帮他
Help him.

492
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,580
快点！
Help him!

493
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,500
给 喝点吧
Here you go. Drink some.

494
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,410
快跟我来
You better come with me.

495
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,200
什么都没有
Nothing.

496
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,910
先生 看守人看到他了
Sir, the watchman saw him.

497
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,450
在迷雾中绕着船转
Circling the ship. In the mist.

498
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,160
我们都亲眼看他沉下去了
We all saw him drown.

499
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,410
先生
Sir.

500
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,000
大家都很恐慌
The men are terrified.

501
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,450
觉得该把那个男人扔到冰面上
They think that man should be surrendered to the ice

502
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,700
结束这一切
and be done with this.

503
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:04,000
他受我保护…
He is under my protection…

504
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,080
受王国庇佑！
and the protection of the Crown!

505
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:24,790
几周后 我、威廉和哈兰德 骑马穿过海峡
A few weeks later, I rode with William and Harlander

506
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:27,450
来到瓦杜兹附近的一个湖边
to a lake near Vaduz across the channel.

507
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,950
这座塔楼是用来过滤农田灌溉用水的
The tower was built as a water filtration plant to irrigate the fields.

508
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,910
是个公共工程项目 所以战争一开始就被弃建了
Public works, so construction was abandoned at the start of the war.

509
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,870
不是这场战争 是前一场
Not this war, the one before.

510
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,660
或者是再前面一场 我记不清了
Or the one before that, I cannot quite remember.

511
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,500
一看到它
The moment I laid eyes on it…

512
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,620
这座塔楼
The tower.

513
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:52,870
我便感受到了命运的召唤
I could feel destiny calling.

514
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,580
建筑结构基本完整
The structure's basically intact.

515
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,750
这里还有一条陡坡道 从顶上直通到底部
And there's a chute going from top, right to the bottom.

516
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,200
我会安排人把你的个人物品
I can arrange for your belongings.

517
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,160
从爱丁堡运过来
We'll bring them from Edinburgh.

518
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:29,660
你需要什么 都能满足
Anything you need or want shall be granted.

519
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,200
-什么都可以？ -什么都可以
-Anything? -Anything.

520
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:45,370
整个项目期间 威廉随叫随到
I have secured William's service for the duration of the project.

521
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:46,700
我要一个临时密室
I'll need a holding cell.

522
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,500
-实验室旁边要有个冷库 -威廉
-And an ice chamber close to the lab. -William.

523
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,790
塔楼底部有两个泵水库
There are two pump reservoirs at the base of the tower.

524
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,290
要改造一下
We'll repurpose those.

525
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:56,290
我们要重启蒸汽机
We shall need to recondition the steam engines.

526
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,160
需要足够的燃料 来保证机器正常运转
We'll need enough fuel to make sure they run.

527
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:02,410
那里 还有那里 放四块高容量的伏打电池
There and there, four high-capacity voltaic batteries,

528
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,160
正负电极
positive and negative polarity,

529
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:08,450
还要一套纯银避雷针系统 向下延伸至实验室
and a lightning rod system of pure silver telescoping down into the lab.

530
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:13,540
没问题 你需要什么设备 我的承包商都能造出来
Yes. My contractors can manufacture any and all equipment you may require.

531
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,000
那么 我们应该达成共识了吧？
I take it then that we have an understanding?

532
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,750
交易达成
A bargain has been struck.

533
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:38,370
混蛋！
Bastard!

534
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,120
这个不行
No. No. Not this one.

535
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:46,250
张嘴
Aah. Open your mouth.

536
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:51,540
被绞死算你走运 你本就活不过今年了
You, you're lucky to be hanged. You would have died within the year.

537
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,120
哈兰德先生答应我 让我拿到最好的样本
Herr Harlander promised me access to optimal specimens.

538
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,870
阁下 他倒是答应了
Yeah, that he may have, your lordship,

539
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,120
可您也知道
but as you well know,

540
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:00,870
犯罪又不是什么好差事 我们这里也只有些歪瓜裂枣
crime doesn't pay, and it's a poor showing of it we have here.

541
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:02,700
哪个都是可怜虫
They're wretches every one of them.

542
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:03,950
真是抱歉
I'm sorry about that.

543
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,120
背很强壮 这个可以
That's a strong back. This one will do.

544
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,290
稍后再来
Come back later.

545
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:44,450
来告解？
Confession?

546
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,200
我很好奇
I was intrigued.

547
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:54,750
如此纤弱又虔诚的人 能有什么要告解的？
What would such a delicate, pious creature have to confess to?

548
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,540
真是碰巧 被我找到了一个机会
As luck would have it, an opportunity presented itself,

549
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,620
我…
and I…

550
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,660
我就要揭开谜底了
I was about to find out.

551
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,700
神父 请为我祝福 我有罪
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

552
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:33,250
孩子 你多久没告解了？
How long has it been since your last confession, my daughter?

553
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:35,540
还没到一周 神父 我在修道院待过
Barely a week, Father. I was in a convent.

554
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,120
就一周？
A week?

555
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:40,580
你就这么轻率地犯错了？
Tsk-tsk. Have you so hastily committed sin?

556
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,580
是的
I have.

557
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,910
是罪孽的念头 并非实际行动
Sin of intent, not deed.

558
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,620
-因为一名男子 对不对？ -对
-A man, is it? -Yes.

559
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,950
是我未婚夫的兄长
My fiancé's brother.

560
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,660
是欲念吗？
Lust?

561
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,580
是憎恶
Hatred.

562
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,500
憎恶…
Hatred…

563
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:56,620
-憎恶？ -那名男子很恶劣、很丑陋
-Hatred? -The man is appalling, grotesque.

564
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,290
这样的话很是刺耳
Harsh words.

565
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:01,000
近乎无情了 对吗？
Rather uncharitable, wouldn't you say?

566
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,540
尊敬的神父 您并不了解这个人
Respectfully, Father, you do not know this man.

567
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:07,080
他试图操控周围一切的人和事
He tries to control and manipulate everything and everyone around him.

568
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,790
他和所有暴君一样 以假扮受害者为乐
Like every tyrant, he delights in playing the victim.

569
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,290
要我说 那是他唯一的本事
His only advantage, I would say,

570
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:13,830
他自以为绅士 实则粗鄙不堪
is he's far cruder than he believes himself to be.

571
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:15,870
粗鄙不堪？
Cruder?

572
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,330
我的孩子 请详细说明
Uh, pray explain yourself, my child.

573
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,080
比如说 他太容易被发现了
For one, he's easy to spot.

574
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,290
即便是集市日的拥挤街道上 也能轻松看到他
You can see him… even on a busy street on market day.

575
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:34,040
说吧 你什么时候发现我的？
Tell me, how soon did you spot me?

576
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,040
只能说远比你看到我来得早
I saw you well before you saw me, I can say that much.

577
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,160
你吃过晚饭了吗？
Have you had supper?

578
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,000
我还不怎么饿 男爵 谢谢
I'm not that hungry, Baron. Thank you.

579
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,540
我就饿坏了
Well, I for one am famished.

580
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:46,540
-谢谢 好心人 -谢谢 先生
-Thank you, my good man. -Thank you, sir.

581
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,910
你买了什么书？能让我看看吗？
What books did you buy, hmm? May I?

582
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,120
你猜
Guess.

583
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:53,290
-让我猜？ -还是猜一下吧
-Guess? -Mm-hmm. I'd rather that you did.

584
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,290
那好
Very well.

585
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,200
言情小说
A romance…

586
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:04,160
沐浴着地中海的阳光 身着丝绸华服 沉醉于爱的纠葛
drenched in Mediterranean sun and silk and the skirmishes of love.

587
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,700
真是无礼 但也不奇怪
Insulting, but unsurprising.

588
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:08,790
是吗？
Really?

589
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,160
昆虫？
-Insects? -Mm.

590
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:20,540
我对科学的兴趣 体现在对微小生物的好奇上
My interest in science leans towards the smallest things.

591
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,950
它们随自然而动 或许是顺应上帝的节律
Moving with nature, perhaps the rhythms of God.

592
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,410
我一直在寻觅 某种更纯粹、更奇妙的事物
I've always searched for something more pure, marvelous.

593
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,200
这就是你在修道院追寻的东西吗？
Is that what you were seeking in the convent?

594
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:38,950
算是吧
In a way.

595
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,120
值得吗？
Was it worth it?

596
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:44,950
有什么是值得的吗？
Is anything?

597
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,700
可以吗？
Permit me, sister.

598
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,620
这样好像不大合适
This hardly seems appropriate.

599
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,250
有什么是合适的吗？
Is anything?

600
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:08,870
很好
Very well.

601
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,580
笑起来！
Laughter!

602
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,620
生平第一次
And for the very first time,

603
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,620
不知何故 我对生的兴趣渐浓
I became more interested in life

604
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,950
对死的兴趣
and somewhat less interested

605
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,160
减淡了
in death.

606
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:55,290
主杆采用快速螺栓固定系统
The main rod has a fast bolting system.

607
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,330
用合金了吗？
Did you use an alloy?

608
00:44:58,330 --> 00:44:59,870
铜锌合金
Copper and zinc.

609
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:02,750
这个不行 重来吧
This is… This simply will not do. Start over.

610
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,160
纯银是完美的导体
Pure silver is a perfect conductor.

611
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:09,120
威廉 你得留下 拜托了
William, you must stay behind. Please.

612
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,120
我最信任的就是你了
I trust you above anyone else.

613
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,410
再多待几天就行
Only for a few more days.

614
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,120
你抓不到它的
You're not going to catch her.

615
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:30,500
真漂亮
Beautiful. Beautiful.

616
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,830
把它关起来 还是放走呢？
-Should we trap her or let her go? -Mm…

617
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:33,750
关起来
Trap her.

618
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:38,080
这下我们有共同点了
Now we have something in common.

619
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:40,790
一个囚徒
A prisoner.

620
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:46,200
威廉如约行事 认真负责建造实验室 满足各种需求
As promised, William took dutiful charge of the laboratory build and needs.

621
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,830
那边能修一下吗？
Can you fix that over there, please?

622
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,330
去帮一下
Go, help.

623
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:55,120
他严格按我的指示办事
He followed my instructions to the letter.

624
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:58,700
电池
The battery.

625
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:09,040
现在是纯银的了
It's all pure silver now.

626
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:13,120
这是和淋巴系统相对应的传导点
Conduction points corresponding to the lymphatic system,

627
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:18,200
非常复杂 但我做出来了
which was quite complex. -But I managed.

628
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:19,250
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

629
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:03,000
哈兰德先生 谢谢 派对很精彩
Herr Harlander, thank you. The party's delightful.

630
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,120
但愿我们没有干扰你做研究
I hope we're not distracting you from your research

631
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:09,790
毕竟你还要顾着我和伊丽莎白
to tend to me and Elizabeth.

632
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,540
完全没有
Not at all.

633
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:16,000
她还年轻 我们得护着她
She's young. She can count on us to guard her.

634
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:21,450
我还是回避一下
I shall leave you your privacy.

635
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,830
我们之间还掩饰什么
No need for subterfuge between us.

636
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:29,540
法国陶瓷 多么美妙的共响
French porcelain, chimes to a man's stream.

637
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:35,370
我快找到解决方法了 给淋巴系统确定传导点
I am very near a solution, an access point to the lymphatic system.

638
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:37,160
哦 那个呀
Ah, yeah, that.

639
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,160
这么久了
It's been so long.

640
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:43,120
仗快打完了
The war is waning.

641
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,160
资金供应也快断了
And my funding will end with it.

642
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:49,700
你不是说资金无限供应吗？
You said your funds were unlimited.

643
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:51,120
但我的耐心是有限的
My patience is not.

644
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:55,750
我得到了可靠消息 一周内会爆发一场战斗
I have it on good authority that a battle is to take place within a week.

645
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:00,950
战争好比潮水 会把战利品送到我们这条海岸上来
The tide of war will deliver its bounty to our shore.

646
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,200
战场上的尸体肯定一塌糊涂
A battlefield? The bodies will be mangled.

647
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:04,200
就一周
One week.

648
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:08,080
-一周？ -一周后 创造历史的机会就会溜走
-One week? -After that, history will pass us by.

649
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,950
帮我冲一下吧 男爵
Flush that for me, will you, Baron?

650
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:19,370
一周内找到传递电流的办法
A week to determine how to deliver the current.

651
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:20,410
绝无可能
Impossible.

652
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:22,830
我该怎么办？
What would I do?

653
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:24,830
就快成功了 我感觉得到
I was close. I could feel it.

654
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:29,500
谁知横生阻碍
And then…life got in the way.

655
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:30,580
哦
Oh.

656
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:33,870
它肯定想你了
I believe she missed you.

657
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,910
伊丽莎白 我得先警告你一下 我在处理解剖体
I must warn you, Elizabeth, I've been working on a dissection.

658
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,040
很美
It's beautiful.

659
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:42,910
吓到你了吗？
Does it shock you?

660
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:46,250
让我想起了殉道主题的绘画
Reminds me of martyrdom paintings.

661
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:50,620
没有了痛苦
Pain is gone.

662
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,370
在对称的构造和形状中 看得到上帝的精妙手笔
You can see God's design in the symmetry and the shapes.

663
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:58,620
伊丽莎白
Elizabeth.

664
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:02,580
我得向你坦白
I must confess something to you.

665
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,580
我相信这世间存在奇妙非凡之物 你也一样
I have a belief in the marvelous and so do you.

666
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:12,040
我们之间有种默契 你能感觉到吗？
There is a bond between us. Can you feel it?

667
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,750
一种近乎生理上的吸引 我坚信这种感觉绝非寻常
An almost physical one. I truly believe it to be something else.

668
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,200
你所信之物 未必是事实
Believing something does not make it true.

669
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:31,580
那你为什么来这里？
Then why are you here?

670
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,250
它很美 对不对？
Beautiful creature, is she not?

671
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:47,330
孤傲 令人沉迷 却又如此怪异
Remote. Entirely bewitching, but so odd.

672
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,160
有三颗心
Three hearts.

673
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,910
复眼 白色的血
Multiple eyes. White blood.

674
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,370
它无法做出选择 所以如此迷人
And a fascinating lack of choice.

675
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:03,080
我不明白
I don't understand.

676
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:06,330
有选择的能力 灵魂才能栖息
Choice is the seat of the soul.

677
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,950
这是上帝对我们的赠礼
The one gift God granted us.

678
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,200
伊丽莎白
Elizabeth…

679
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:22,540
我做出选择了
I have chosen.

680
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,120
晚安
Good night.

681
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:31,750
伊丽莎白！
Elizabeth!

682
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:35,870
伊丽莎白！
Elizabeth!

683
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:41,660
我以为我失败了
I thought I had failed.

684
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,500
以为一切都完了 以为…
I thought it was entirely over. I thought…

685
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:48,000
我以为…
And I thought…

686
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,000
我…
And I…

687
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:52,250
对称性
The symmetry.

688
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,750
上帝创造的对称性 对
God's symmetry. Yes, yes.

689
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,000
找到了
Yes.

690
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:31,540
把电池放在淋巴系统上
Placing the battery above the lymphatic system.

691
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,950
我就这么找到了解题的关键
I had found the key.

692
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:36,410
再也没有什么能阻挡我了
Nothing could stop me now.

693
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:39,540
没有
Nothing.

694
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:44,540
别动！这堆尸体
No! No, do not take any bodies

695
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:47,790
顶上的和底部的都别搬 就搬我做了标记的
from the top or the bottom of the pile unless I mark them.

696
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:50,080
冰冻或腐败可能会破坏组织
Ice or rot may have destroyed the tissue.

697
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:52,160
就看中间的那些
Look only in the middle.

698
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:02,620
东西太多 会让人晕头转向 除非目标非常明确
Abundance can be disorienting unless one hones one's aim.

699
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,450
我想要个子高的 长手长脚的
I'm favoring tall specimens, long limbs.

700
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,290
划定范围 活就好干了
Scale will make the work easier.

701
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:08,330
我喜欢
I like that.

702
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:11,330
尽善尽美嘛
Perfection.

703
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:14,200
有什么不好呢 亲爱的男爵？
And why not, dear Baron?

704
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:17,120
确实 有什么不好呢？
Indeed, why not?

705
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:19,450
找到完整的人头
Look for a head that's intact.

706
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:21,830
搬到车上去
Put that one in the cart.

707
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,370
那个放那边
Set that one over there.

708
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:29,910
其他的送过来
Bring the others.

709
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:36,870
老天
Oh, good God.

710
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:51,910
劳驾
Do you mind?

711
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,620
大功告成
It is finished.

712
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:06,830
哈兰德先生！
Herr Harlander!

713
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:09,200
暴风雨要来了！
A storm is coming!

714
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:12,870
我的拐杖
My cane.

715
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,200
我的拐杖！
My cane!

716
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:17,120
我的拐杖 手柄打开
My cane, in the handle.

717
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:27,700
水银
Mercury.

718
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:29,500
-你病了吗？ -谢谢
-Are you ill? -Thank you.

719
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:42,580
是梅毒吗？
Is it… syphilis?

720
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:46,540
对 我快死了
Yeah, I'm dying.

721
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,700
一夜偷欢 终生服毒
One night with Venus, a lifetime with Mercury.

722
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:52,910
是这么说的吧？
Isn't that the phrase?

723
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,700
几期了？
What stage?

724
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:55,620
二期？
Secondary?

725
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,830
你我都清楚会怎么发展
We both know the precise schedule.

726
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:00,620
已经在啃噬我的骨头了
It starts to eat away my bones,

727
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:06,330
眼眶、脸颊、牙齿、下颌、颅骨 层层侵蚀 直到抵达大脑
orbital, cheek, teeth, jaw, skull, exposing my brain.

728
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:10,160
长瘤、发狂、剧痛
Tumors, madness, excruciating pain.

729
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:15,910
到某个清晨 我会开始尖叫 停不下来
One fine morning, I will start to scream and I will never stop.

730
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:19,750
我无法接受如此不堪地死去
I cannot face such a vulgar demise.

731
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:23,160
于是我想到了我唯一的要求
Which brings me to my one condition.

732
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:27,200
我们约定好的交易
Our deal. As agreed, in exchange

733
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:29,950
我为你慷慨解囊所能换取的东西
for my generous intervention on your behalf.

734
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:34,790
既然我们即将造出新人类
And as we give life to our new Adam,

735
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:37,830
我想要拥有这具完美新身体
I want to be placed in this new perfect body.

736
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:41,500
不行
No.

737
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:44,950
-不可以 -当然可以
-No, no. -Yes.

738
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,910
还没到时候！
Not now. Not now!

739
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,910
-正是这时候 -这事我们以后再聊 现在不行
-Precisely now. -We'll talk about this after, not now.

740
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,040
哪还有什么以后！
There is no after!

741
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:54,200
没有以后了
There is no after.

742
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,040
你要的一切 我都给你了！
I gave you everything you wanted!

743
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,290
你要什么 我都给你
I give you everything you ask for.

744
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:45,750
随你说
Name it, it's yours.

745
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:48,000
你要伊丽莎白都行
Even Elizabeth.

746
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,040
求你了
Please.

747
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,620
礼貌一点总有效果
"Please" always helps.

748
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:57,450
你已经病入膏肓了
The disease has spread all inside of you.

749
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,660
这是全身性疾病 你知道的
It's systemic, and you know it.

750
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:01,700
你的每个器官都感染了
Every organ in you is polluted.

751
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:03,870
大脑 血液 全都感染了
Your brain, your blood, it's all polluted.

752
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:05,500
但我还有钱啊 对不对？
But my money's not, is that it?

753
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:06,580
无济于事
It's impossible.

754
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:12,250
我只要你说一个“行”字
Now, all you need to say is one simple word.

755
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:14,540
别的什么都不要说
"Yes," no more and no less.

756
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:16,450
不行！听明白了吗？不行！
No! Do you understand? No!

757
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,330
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

758
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:30,700
住手！
Stop!

759
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,500
住手
Stop.

760
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:34,950
没了这个 我们就一无所有了 我们俩都会完蛋
If we lose that, we have nothing. We both lose.

761
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,750
普罗米修斯 我就是啄食你肝脏的鹰！
I will be the eagle that feasts on your liver!

762
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:38,910
求你了 住手！
Please, stop!

763
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:41,160
哈兰德先生！
Herr Harlander. Herr Harlander!

764
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,290
坚持住 看着我！
Hold on, look at me!

765
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,370
不！哈兰德先生
No! Herr Harlander!

766
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:34,450
不要啊
No, no. No!

767
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:08,080
不！
No, no, no!

768
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:09,540
不！
No!

769
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:28,500
不！
No! No! No!

770
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,120
你骗了我
You lied to me.

771
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:43,370
骗了我
You lied.

772
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:52,250
维克多！
Victor!

773
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:54,580
维克多！
Victor!

774
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:34,790
别过来 求你了
No, please.

775
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:03,250
看 一样的
Look. Same.

776
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:14,950
太阳
Sun.

777
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,370
阳光
Sun. Light.

778
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:21,370
去感受一下
Face it.

779
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:24,250
阳光 太阳…
Sunlight. The sun is…

780
01:04:24,330 --> 01:04:25,830
太阳是生命之源
The sun is life.

781
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:29,750
很温暖
Ah, the warmth. Huh?

782
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:32,290
没错
Yes! Yes.

783
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:42,910
维克多
Victor.

784
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:45,830
维克多
Victor.

785
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,290

786
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,660
对 你就是

787
01:04:55,370 --> 01:04:56,450
你当然就是
Of course you are.

788
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,620
维克多
Victor.

789
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:11,500
邮件来了
The mail, sir.

790
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,500
老庄园来的信
Letters from the old estate.

791
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
日内瓦
Geneva.

792
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:17,910
-有我叔叔的来信吗？ -没有
-Is there anything from my uncle? -No.

793
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,950
或许我们该去拜访一下他们了
Perhaps we should pay them a visit.

794
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:30,290
小心 看着脚下
Careful. Look. Look down.

795
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:34,500
水
Water. Water.

796
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:37,870
水
Water.

797
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:39,660
对 水
Yes, water.

798
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:41,080
-维克多 -不 我是维克多

799
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:42,500
这是水 来这里
That's water. Come here.

800
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:44,330
-维克多 -来吧 很好
-Victor. -Come now, come. All right, good.

801
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:46,080
要跨一大步
We're going to take a big step.

802
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,410
我们一起来 准备好了？
We'll do it together. Ready?

803
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,200
-走这边 这样 -维克多
This way, like this.

804
01:05:49,830 --> 01:05:52,080
不是那样 走这边
No, not like that. This way.

805
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:54,250
别碰 烫
Oh, no, no, no. Hot, hot.

806
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:56,250
不能碰 别碰它
No, don't touch. Don't touch that.

807
01:05:56,330 --> 01:05:57,290
烫
It's hot.

808
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,830
坐下 很好 真棒
Sit. Very good. Very good. Yes.

809
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:10,910
好 看这是什么
Yes. Now, look what I have here.

810
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,750
看这个 这是什么？
Look at this. What is this thing?

811
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:14,950
这个怪东西是什么？当心
What is this strange thing? Careful.

812
01:06:16,330 --> 01:06:17,290
你力气很大
You're very strong.

813
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:19,540
好了 这样
Yes. And like this. Huh?

814
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:24,200
还想要那个？好 这个放这里
Yes, you want another? Yes, this one goes right here.

815
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:25,160
钥匙
Key.

816
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:27,410
维克多
Victor.

817
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:32,200
这样你就不会着凉了
This will keep you nice and warm.

818
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:34,000
披上一条好毯子 暖暖的
Nice blanket to keep you warm.

819
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:36,080
维克多
-Victor.

820
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,370
好了
All right.

821
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:39,450
你待在这里
You stay.

822
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:41,910
就待在这里
You stay here now.

823
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:45,910
待着别动
Stay here now.

824
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:48,450
我去去就回 待着别动
I'll be back. All right. Stay there.

825
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:52,370
维克多
Victor.

826
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:56,410
别动 没事的
No, no, no, no, no. It's all right.

827
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,080
我会回来的
I'll come back.

828
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,120
维克多
Victor.

829
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:08,370
维克多
Victor.

830
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:11,410
对他来说 一切都是新的
Everything was new to him.

831
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:16,750
温暖、冰冷、阳光、黑暗
Warmth, cold, light, darkness.

832
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:19,540
我的任务是塑造他
And I was there to mold him.

833
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,290
造成之后的事 我还从未考虑过
I never considered what would come after creation.

834
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,950
来到世界尽头
And having reached the edge of the earth,

835
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,700
才发现没有地平线
there was no horizon left.

836
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:35,870
如此成就有种非自然的感觉
The achievement felt unnatural.

837
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:41,950
并无意义
Void of meaning.

838
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:46,370
这让我十分烦恼
And this troubled me so.

839
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:49,910
船员们都想回去
Your men, they wish to go back.

840
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:50,830
对吗？
Yes?

841
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:52,330
可能吧
Probably.

842
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:57,080
不过一旦船能开动 我们就会继续前行
But the moment we're free, we're setting sails forwards.

843
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,450
不管付出什么代价
No matter the cost.

844
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:00,040
你简直和我一样疯狂
You share my madness.

845
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:06,160
我向你讲述自己的故事 或许别有深意
Perhaps there is a finer point in me telling you my story.

846
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,290
男爵 不管是否如此
Whether there is or isn't, Baron…

847
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,200
我都愿意听
I'd like to hear it.

848
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:16,290
几周过去了
Weeks passed,

849
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:20,080
他的力量迅速增强 我却日渐衰弱
and as his strength increased rapidly, mine waned.

850
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:24,160
可惜他没学会更多的话 也没有别的进展
Alas, no further language or development occurred.

851
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,830
不对
No, no, no, no, no, no.

852
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:30,080
低头
Down, down, down, down.

853
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:31,540
这就对了
Yes, there we are.

854
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,830
可以了 别动
There we are. Stay there. Stay.

855
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,200
这就是你
Yes, that's you.

856
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:40,580
这是你 知道了吗？
That's you. All right?

857
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:48,620
愈合得很好
Oh, yes, this is healing rather nicely.

858
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:51,750
我累了
I'm tired.

859
01:08:53,870 --> 01:08:55,330
我好久没睡了
I have not slept.

860
01:08:56,830 --> 01:09:00,950
一点都没睡
Not a winky-dinky-doo of sleep for me.

861
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,330
一直在照顾你
Tending to you.

862
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:05,330
终于给你脸上刮干净了
I've finished shaving you.

863
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:12,500
不行 别动
No, no, stop, stop.

864
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:14,910
放下 不可以 松开
Let go. No, no, no, no, no, no. Open.

865
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,080
手松开 快松开
Open your hand. Open. Open it.

866
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,330
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

867
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:24,660
看看你都干了什么
Look. Look what you've done.

868
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:27,330
你要听我的话 我说了放下
You have to listen to me. You have to listen. I said drop it.

869
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,290
真蠢！不 别这样
Stupidity! No. Stop.

870
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:33,080
来
Come here.

871
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,580
-维克多 -不 别碰我！
-Victor. -No, don't touch me!

872
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:37,080
永远都别碰我！
Don't ever touch me!

873
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:44,950
来吧
Come here.

874
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:47,830
不是我 是你自己弄的
I didn't do this. You did this.

875
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,290
伤口
The wound.

876
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:56,540
闭合了
It's closed.

877
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:58,080
怎么会的
But how?

878
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:02,790
好了
All right.

879
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,160
不行
No, no, no.

880
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:09,660
别动
No.

881
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:12,790
别动
No.

882
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,830
好了
All right. All right.

883
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:25,290
肯定一切都好
I'm sure everything's all right.

884
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,580
很快就到了
We'll be there soon enough.

885
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:33,790
我知道你有想法 我知道
I know you have thoughts. I know.

886
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:35,040
我知道你有
I know you do.

887
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,580
就在这里面 你有想法
Somewhere in there. Somewhere in there you have thoughts.

888
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:39,790
是不是？
Hmm? Don't you?

889
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:41,790
你想说什么吗？
Something you might want to say?

890
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:43,870
虽然脑子里很乱、很困惑
However jumbled, however confused?

891
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:45,620
有想法吗？
Hmm? Something?

892
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:47,540
还是我太心急了？
Am I presuming too much?

893
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:48,660
维克多
Victor.

894
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:51,790
知道了！
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

895
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:53,750
这个已经教会你了
This much we have established.

896
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:56,040
那是我的名字 我的名字是维克多
That is my name. My name is Victor.

897
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,450
你还能说点别的吗？什么都可以
Is there anything else that you can say? Anything at all? Hmm?

898
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:01,910
有吗？
Anything? Anything?

899
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:03,950
太阳
Um, sun, hmm?

900
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:08,910
冷、雨、血 任何东西
Cold. Rain. Blood. Anything.

901
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,870
靴子 靴子会说吗？
Boot. Can you say "boot"?

902
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:12,580
维克多
Victor.

903
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:17,160
够了！那么…
No, yes, no, yes! How about…

904
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:18,950
手呢？手会说吗？
How about "hand"? Can you say "hand"?

905
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,750
手 说啊…
Hand. Hand.

906
01:11:25,870 --> 01:11:27,330
你这是怕我吗？
Oh. Oh, oh. You are afraid of me?

907
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,250
你怕我？
You're afraid of me?

908
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:32,580
为什么？为什么你会怕我？
Why? Why would you be afraid of me?

909
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:34,040
我不会伤害你的
I'm not going to hurt you.

910
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:36,410
我不会伤害你的 是我造了你
I'm not going to hurt you. I made you.

911
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,290
是我造了你！别这样了！
I'm your maker! Stop it!

912
01:11:56,450 --> 01:11:58,290
你们来了 真的来了
You're here. You're really here.

913
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:00,870
来吧 快进来
Come on, then. Come, come.

914
01:12:02,410 --> 01:12:04,910
伊丽莎白 我得说 我有好多东西要给你看
I have to tell you. I have so much to show you, Elizabeth.

915
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,910
特别奇妙 你都不敢相信
You won't believe it. It's absolutely marvelous.

916
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,660
快来 先给你看我的笔记
Come, come, I'll show you my notes first.

917
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:10,200
我叔叔在这里吗？
Is my uncle here?

918
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:11,870
什么？
What?

919
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:13,870
我叔叔 他在这里吗？
My uncle, is he here?

920
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:14,830
不在
No, no.

921
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:17,080
这里就我一个人 他不在
No, I'm alone. He's not here.

922
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:20,000
-他…他几天后会回来 -维克多 你看着状态不大好
-He's… He'll be back in a few days. -You don't look very well, Victor.

923
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,830
我的状态从来没这么好过！ 我的头脑清晰多了！快来！
Oh, I've never felt better! I've never had a clearer mind! Come, come!

924
01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:24,540
你发烧了吗？
Are you running a fever?

925
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:27,080
我只是看到你太激动了
I am just very excited to see you.

926
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:30,000
我太高兴了 简直要飞起来了
I'm exalted. The spirits have lifted me so much.

927
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,250
那东西太神奇了 我就知道能实现
Absolutely marvelous…

928
01:12:32,790 --> 01:12:34,410
维克多
Victor…

929
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:39,450
维克多 请给我一点时间
Victor. Victor.

930
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:54,870
是谁伤害了你？
Who hurt you?

931
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:57,500
威廉 你一定要看看这个
I have to show you this, William.

932
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:00,040
我先整理一下
Let me organize it for you.

933
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,330
我也有东西要给你看
And I have something to show to you.

934
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:06,000
我跟英国皇家医学会的人聊过了
I've spoken to the Royal Medical Society.

935
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:09,160
-他们想见你 -现在还不行
-They're interested in seeing you. -No, no, no, not yet.

936
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:11,080
我还没准备好
I'm not quite ready yet.

937
01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:14,410
我以为这是你一直以来的梦想
I thought that's what you always wanted.

938
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:19,540
那个男人
The man.

939
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,200
-楼下的那个男人 -你看到他了？
-The man downstairs. -You saw him?

940
01:15:22,910 --> 01:15:25,160
他是病人吗？是被你打伤的吗？
Is he a patient? A victim?

941
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:29,200
他身上好多伤口 你竟然下手那么重
His wounds. You wounded him like that.

942
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:32,000
不 伤害他的是这个世界 伊丽莎白
No, no, no. It was the world that hurt him, Elizabeth.

943
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,790
我给了他生命
I… I gave him life.

944
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:36,620
我给了他生命
I gave him life.

945
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,040
起来
Up, up, up.

946
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:41,870
来
Come on.

947
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:45,250
慢着
There, there, there…

948
01:15:45,330 --> 01:15:47,540
他还在适应周围的环境
He's still getting used to his surroundings.

949
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,160
它很强壮 威廉
It is strong, William.

950
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:55,120
-你成功了 -非常强壮
-You did it. -It's so strong.

951
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:56,750
你成功了
You did it.

952
01:15:57,330 --> 01:15:59,290
体内所有系统都正常运作
All its systems are functional.

953
01:15:59,370 --> 01:16:00,330
伤口都在愈合
All healing.

954
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:04,580
愈合的状态不稳定
And the healing is erratic, yes.

955
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:06,500
但是非同寻常
But exceptional.

956
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:16,120
他为什么被拴在这里？
Why is he chained here?

957
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,870
为了保护他自己 还有我
For his own safety and for mine,

958
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:21,620
也更方便给它清洁维护
and it's easy to clean and, uh, maintain it.

959
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:23,120
很多事它还不懂
And it doesn't know any better.

960
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:25,500
但你懂
But you do.

961
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:29,910
哈兰德知道了吗？
Does Harlander know?

962
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:35,000
我们要在他回来之前把一切准备好…
We have to prepare everything for the moment he returns.

963
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,250
-当然 -…让一切都有模有样
-Of course. -And have everything presentable.

964
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:42,500
它有智慧吗？
Is it intelligent?

965
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:48,330
维克多 它有智慧吗？
Victor, is it intelligent?

966
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:05,250
我无法理解你是怎么做到的
I can't fathom how exactly you did what you did,

967
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:07,750
但这无疑是一项壮举
but its dimension does not escape me.

968
01:17:10,290 --> 01:17:14,000
维克多 你有没有问过自己
Victor, did you ever ask yourself,

969
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,910
这个人的所有组成部分中
of all the parts that make that man,

970
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:19,830
哪块是灵魂藏身的地方？
which one holds the soul?

971
01:17:26,450 --> 01:17:27,950
我没问过
No, I didn't.

972
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:32,040
楼下那头怪物总让人感到不安
There's something so disquieting about that creature down there.

973
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:36,500
扭曲诡异 像个在哈哈镜里探头探脑的身影
Askew, like a figure peeking around a funhouse mirror.

974
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:38,450
但很有活力
But animated.

975
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:40,450
是哪里来的活力？
Animated by what?

976
01:18:45,330 --> 01:18:46,370
痛吗？
Does it hurt?

977
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:55,450
叶子？
A leaf?

978
01:18:55,950 --> 01:18:56,950
给我的吗？
For me?

979
01:18:57,830 --> 01:18:58,950
谢谢
Thank you.

980
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,370
是不是很美？
Isn't it beautiful?

981
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:06,830
给我的吗？
This is for me?

982
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:09,620
我是伊丽莎白
I'm Elizabeth.

983
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:13,120
会说吗？伊丽莎白
Can you say "Elizabeth"?

984
01:19:14,290 --> 01:19:15,330
伊丽莎白
Elizabeth.

985
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:19,160
从喉咙里发出声音
My throat makes sounds.

986
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:20,830
伊丽莎白
Elizabeth.

987
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:38,910
我要走了
I'm going to go now.

988
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:56,950
伊丽莎…白
Eliza… beth.

989
01:19:58,830 --> 01:20:00,580
你不该靠近那东西的
You should not go near it.

990
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:03,540
那东西？
"It"?

991
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:07,660
没错 那东西
It. Yes.

992
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:12,370
那东西是活的 但没有智慧的火花
I believe there is life in it, but not the spark of intelligence

993
01:20:12,450 --> 01:20:13,450
我故意这么设计的
that I had intended.

994
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:15,160
可能不是你想象的那样
Perhaps not as you understand it.

995
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:16,870
什么地方出了差错
Something went wrong.

996
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:19,370
阻塞了 缝合了 连通了
A blockage, a suture, a connection.

997
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:21,950
伟大的维克多·弗兰肯斯坦 还会犯错？
You, the great Victor Frankenstein, you made a mistake?

998
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:24,250
那头怪物只会一个词 仅有的一个
The Creature knows but one word, and one word alone.

999
01:20:24,330 --> 01:20:26,290
维克多
"Victor, Victor, Victor, Victor."

1000
01:20:26,370 --> 01:20:28,870
只是莫名其妙地机械重复
It just parrots it without rhyme or reason.

1001
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:31,950
也许在当下 那个词就是他的一切
Perhaps for the time being that word means everything to him.

1002
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:35,370
要是重生后的他 获得活力的源泉其实更简单
What if in being anew, the spirit that animates him is simpler,

1003
01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:36,580
-更纯粹… -纯粹？
-purer-- -Purer?

1004
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:38,540
比普通人的更纯粹呢？
Purer than that of the common man?

1005
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:44,950
要是他不受制于原罪
What if, unrestrained by sin,

1006
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,870
而造物主为这具伤痕累累的血肉之躯 直接注入了生气呢？
our creator's breath came into its wounded flesh directly?

1007
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:50,080
天啊 伊丽莎白
Good God, Elizabeth.

1008
01:20:51,910 --> 01:20:54,040
要是我强迫自己信了你这话
If I could force myself to believe it,

1009
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:58,160
我会觉得你是不是被这东西吸引了
it would be my inclination to see attraction in you for that thing.

1010
01:20:58,250 --> 01:20:59,620
好好理解一下
Understanding.

1011
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:01,910
他的眼中有痛苦的情绪
In those eyes I saw pain,

1012
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,040
没有智慧 何来痛苦？
and what is pain if not evidence of intelligence?

1013
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:05,250
那我的痛苦算什么？
What about my pain?

1014
01:21:05,910 --> 01:21:07,450
被你拒绝算什么？
What about what you have denied me?

1015
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:10,500
我的心想要什么？
What my heart wants…

1016
01:21:11,870 --> 01:21:12,910
你的心？
Your heart?

1017
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:17,660
所有人体结构中
Of all the human anatomy,

1018
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:20,330
只有心最难捉摸
that is the organ furthest from your understanding.

1019
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:23,290
男爵 只有怪物会扮演上帝
Only monsters play God, Baron.

1020
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:31,250
比普通人更纯粹
Purer than the common man, hmm?

1021
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:38,700
不知怎的 我成了坏人
And I, somehow, the villain. Mm-hmm.

1022
01:21:40,870 --> 01:21:42,620
你的心很纯粹？
Your heart is pure?

1023
01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:44,910
我向你保证 并非如此
I assure you it isn't.

1024
01:21:45,410 --> 01:21:47,120
我知道 因为是我亲手放进去的
I should know. I put it there.

1025
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:48,450
上去
Up.

1026
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:00,950
再试一下
Let us try again.

1027
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:05,290
腿伸出来
Now give me your leg.

1028
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,000
腿！
Leg!

1029
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:09,500
腿伸出来！
Give me your leg!

1030
01:22:10,370 --> 01:22:12,750
没有智慧 何来痛苦？
Pain is evidence of intelligence, is it not?

1031
01:22:13,330 --> 01:22:14,790
行 测试一下这个说法吧
Well, let's test the theory.

1032
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:17,450
腿伸出来！
Give me your leg!

1033
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:19,120
腿！
Leg!

1034
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,000
腿！
Leg!

1035
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:22,290
快点！
Come on!

1036
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:24,160
伸出来 你个野兽！
Give it to me, you beast!

1037
01:22:25,830 --> 01:22:28,330
腿伸出来！
Give me your leg!

1038
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,040
腿！
Leg!

1039
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:35,700
维克多！
Victor!

1040
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:38,910
维克多！
Victor!

1041
01:22:41,370 --> 01:22:43,200
维克多！
Victor!

1042
01:22:43,290 --> 01:22:46,290
维克多！
Victor! Victor!

1043
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:47,950
维克多 怎么了？
What is it, Victor?

1044
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:50,250
来
Come. Come.

1045
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:53,910
我失败了 我犯了大错
I failed. I made a mistake.

1046
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:56,660
-你没有失败 我看过你的图纸了 -失败了
-No, you didn't fail. I saw your papers. -I did.

1047
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:58,790
-非常完美 -那头怪物极其危险
-It's perfect. -The Creature is extremely dangerous.

1048
01:22:58,870 --> 01:23:00,620
没有…维克多
There's not… Victor.

1049
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,120
我们等哈兰德回来 再一起讨论吧
Let's wait for Harlander and discuss together.

1050
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,540
威廉 有件事我得告诉你
William, there is something you should know.

1051
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:07,620
我得给你看一下
Something I have to show you.

1052
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:16,370
-哈兰德… -那头怪物突然暴怒 把他杀了
-Ha-- Harlander… -In a fit of rage, he killed him.

1053
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:25,870
这下你知道 我为什么没有及时告诉你了吧？
Do you understand now why I was hesitant to share this with you?

1054
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:28,200
当然也不敢让伊丽莎白知道
And certainly not with Elizabeth.

1055
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:33,500
那现在怎么办？
S… So what's to be done now?

1056
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:34,950
什么？
What?

1057
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,660
-现在怎么办？ -你说怎么办？
-What's to be done? -"What's to be done"?

1058
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:38,450
你得带伊丽莎白回维也纳
You must take Elizabeth back to Vienna.

1059
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:41,790
就说出了急事 必须马上走
Tell her something urgent came up and you have to leave immediately.

1060
01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:43,250
千万别让她知道
Keep her in the dark.

1061
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:45,540
这是为了保护她
For her own safety.

1062
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:47,580
必须照我说的办
You have to do as I say.

1063
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:50,450
我们很快就回来 但现在只能先走
We'll be back in no time. But for now, this is for the best.

1064
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:53,750
请上马车吧
Now get in the carriage, please.

1065
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:08,910
你觉得那头怪物能活多久？
The Creature, what's its lifespan, you think?

1066
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:12,660
必然没多久
Brief. Very brief, I'm sure.

1067
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:01,120
我有种很坏的预感
I have the most terrible feeling.

1068
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:06,040
怎么了？
What is it?

1069
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:08,950
让马车回头
Turn the carriage around.

1070
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,500
你一个人去维也纳吧
You go to Vienna.

1071
01:25:12,830 --> 01:25:15,580
让马车回头 否则我就跳车 他要杀了他
Turn the carriage around or I will jump. He's going to kill him.

1072
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,580
说个词吧
Say one word.

1073
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,580
再说一个 随便什么
One word more. Anything.

1074
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:30,580
你说了 我就不杀你
Make me save you.

1075
01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:36,950
维克多
-Victor. -Mm-hmm.

1076
01:25:44,870 --> 01:25:46,950
伊丽莎白
Elizabeth.

1077
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:30,950
维克多！
Victor! Victor!

1078
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:38,620
维克多！
Victor!

1079
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:41,620
维克多！
Victor!

1080
01:27:31,450 --> 01:27:33,700
但故事并未结束
But that was not the end of it.

1081
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:37,080
我试着创造生命 结果造就了死亡
In seeking life, I created death.

1082
01:27:43,330 --> 01:27:45,950
看来又要和他们聊聊了
It would seem I need to address my men again.

1083
01:27:50,290 --> 01:27:51,120
别担心
Don't worry.

1084
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:52,950
他们会听我的话的
They'll listen to me.

1085
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:00,450
住手！别伤害他！我在这里
No, no, stop! Do not harm him! I'm here.

1086
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:01,950
带走我吧
Take me.

1087
01:28:02,870 --> 01:28:04,040
来吧 野兽
Go on, beast.

1088
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:07,580
把我俩都杀了 证明造你的人说的都是真的
Kill us both. Confirm your maker's tale.

1089
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:18,040
造我的人 说了他的故事
My maker… told his tale.

1090
01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:26,660
那我也来说说我的
Then I will tell you mine.

1091
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:33,080
（第二部分 那头怪物的故事）

1092
01:28:42,790 --> 01:28:48,410
维克多！
Victor!

1093
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:52,830
我反复呼唤你的名字 终于发现这里只有我
I called your name and understood I was alone.

1094
01:32:52,870 --> 01:32:54,200
-那是什么？ -开枪！
-What is that? -Shoot at it!

1095
01:32:54,290 --> 01:32:55,120
开枪！
Shoot it!

1096
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:02,330
打到了吗？
Did you get it?

1097
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:06,700
去哪了？
Where is it?

1098
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:28,910
身上的伤口愈合了
My wounds had healed.

1099
01:33:31,910 --> 01:33:35,700
但我觉得寒冷刺骨
But I felt cold, so cold.

1100
01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:10,540
-能把火生起来吗？ -好
-Can you start the fire? -All right.

1101
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:12,540
我会尽快把畜栏修好
And I'll repair the corral as soon as I can.

1102
01:35:19,410 --> 01:35:20,950
你没事吧 打到了吗？
You all right, then? Did you get it?

1103
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:23,370
没有 我们到处看了 就是找不到
Nah, we looked everywhere. Couldn't find that thing.

1104
01:35:23,450 --> 01:35:25,080
虽然我们朝它开了两枪
Though we shot at it two times.

1105
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:27,330
血迹在离这里一公里多的地方消失了
Blood trail died about a mile from here.

1106
01:35:27,410 --> 01:35:29,250
好 进来吧
All right. Come in. Come in.

1107
01:35:29,830 --> 01:35:34,040
我们跟了它一段时间 接着它就消失了
We followed it for a while and then it disappeared. Gone.

1108
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:36,120
那是什么东西？熊吗？
What was it? Was it a bear?

1109
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:39,500
不是熊 也不是人类 我从没见过那样的东西
That was no bear or human. I've never seen anything like it.

1110
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:40,950
那么是幽灵吗？
Was it a ghost, then?

1111
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:44,290
不是 它流血了 说明它有血肉 有骨头
It was no ghost. We drew blood. It was flesh and bone.

1112
01:35:44,370 --> 01:35:45,620
来这边
Come, come. Over here.

1113
01:35:45,700 --> 01:35:47,120
你还看到了什么
Tell me more about what you saw.

1114
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:50,120
安娜玛丽亚 带祖父去壁炉边
Anna-Maria, take your grandfather over by the fireplace.

1115
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:51,700
让他暖一暖
Make sure he's comfortable.

1116
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:54,120
到这边来 祖父
Over here, Grandfather.

1117
01:35:56,370 --> 01:35:58,410
我们钻到了森林深处 还是没找到它
We went deep into the forest. Couldn't find it.

1118
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:06,000
会抓到它的
We will get it.

1119
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:07,660
-就是要花些时间 -好
-It'll take time. -Yeah.

1120
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:10,410
安娜玛丽亚 过来
Anna-Maria, come.

1121
01:36:10,910 --> 01:36:12,750
宝贝 来带我出去
Come, love. Help me outside.

1122
01:36:23,370 --> 01:36:25,370
那位老人触动了我
The old man moved me.

1123
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:32,700
他失明的双目充满智慧
And his unseeing eyes were full of wisdom.

1124
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:47,620
这些人会发出一种声音
These people possessed a sound.

1125
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,910
用来和彼此
Used it to tell each other

1126
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,500
交流感受和想法
about feelings and ideas.

1127
01:36:56,160 --> 01:36:58,370
他们把这种声音叫言语
They called them words.

1128
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:02,790
注意看
Pay attention.

1129
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:04,580
这是什么？
What is this?

1130
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:06,160
一个男孩
A boy.

1131
01:37:07,410 --> 01:37:09,200
-再说一遍 -一个男孩
-And again. -A boy.

1132
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:11,410
很好 孩子
Very good, my child.

1133
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:13,870
这个呢？
And this?

1134
01:37:13,950 --> 01:37:16,000
一只…一只眼睛
An… An eye.

1135
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:18,620
-再说一遍 -一只眼睛
-And again. -An eye.

1136
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:21,700
很好 乖孩子
Yeah. Well done. Well done, my girl.

1137
01:37:21,790 --> 01:37:23,790
-眼睛 -这个呢？
-Eye. -And this one?

1138
01:37:23,870 --> 01:37:24,830
手
The hand.

1139
01:37:24,910 --> 01:37:26,870
-很好 -手
-Very good. -Hand.

1140
01:37:27,790 --> 01:37:28,700
来搭把手
Give us a hand.

1141
01:37:28,790 --> 01:37:31,160
用绳子把最大的捆住带回去
Tie a rope around the biggest one back there.

1142
01:37:31,250 --> 01:37:33,660
我渴望加入这个家庭
I longed to be part of this family.

1143
01:37:34,330 --> 01:37:36,370
冬天之前要再多储备一些柴火
We'll need more kindling before the winter.

1144
01:37:36,450 --> 01:37:38,000
我们得跑几趟
We'll take a few trips.

1145
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:40,540
渴望帮他们的忙
To be their benefactor.

1146
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:42,830
需要大一点的树干来搭这个
We'll need larger trunks for the structure.

1147
01:37:42,910 --> 01:37:43,750
好
All right.

1148
01:37:43,830 --> 01:37:46,750
我能为他们做点什么呢？
What could I possibly do for them?

1149
01:37:52,290 --> 01:37:55,250
安娜玛丽亚！父亲！
Anna-Maria! Father!

1150
01:37:55,330 --> 01:37:57,450
快来看啊！
Come! Come and see!

1151
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:01,080
看啊 安娜玛丽亚！
Look, Anna-Maria!

1152
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:02,870
看 还有呢！快看！
Look, there's more! Look!

1153
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:06,620
这会是谁送来的？
Who could have done this?

1154
01:38:09,870 --> 01:38:11,660
是森林精灵
The Spirit of the Forest.

1155
01:38:13,290 --> 01:38:14,540
我们得谢谢他
We should thank him.

1156
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:17,330
谢谢你
Thank you.

1157
01:38:17,410 --> 01:38:20,120
说“谢谢你 森林精灵”
Say, "Thank you, Spirit of the Forest."

1158
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:23,250
谢谢你 森林精灵
Thank you. Thank you, Spirit of the Forest.

1159
01:38:23,330 --> 01:38:24,330
谢谢
Thank you.

1160
01:38:25,370 --> 01:38:26,870
来吧 看这里
Come. Look over here.

1161
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:34,540
谢谢你
Thank you.

1162
01:38:36,620 --> 01:38:40,250
从此以后 我就成了 他们看不见的守护者
From then on, I became their invisible guardian.

1163
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:43,250
森林精灵
The Spirit of the Forest.

1164
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:49,160
他们也不时对我释放小小的善意
And on occasion, they too extended a small kindness towards me.

1165
01:38:50,330 --> 01:38:52,540
送上衣服、面包
Clothes, bread.

1166
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:56,790
在那段时光
And for a moment,

1167
01:38:57,370 --> 01:39:00,410
极为短暂的时光
a brief, brief moment,

1168
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:03,540
我和这个世界相安无事
the world and I were at peace.

1169
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:13,290
跟上
Come along. Come along.

1170
01:39:13,370 --> 01:39:14,250
进去吧 对
In you go. Yeah.

1171
01:39:14,330 --> 01:39:15,700
记得关门
Make sure you close that gate.

1172
01:39:15,790 --> 01:39:17,580
是谁做的呢？
Who could have done this?

1173
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:19,790
森林精灵吧
The Spirit of the Forest, eh?

1174
01:39:20,910 --> 01:39:21,910
我知道了
I got it.

1175
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:28,790
“最终 这个骄傲的年轻男子
"And in the end, the proud young man

1176
01:39:28,870 --> 01:39:32,080
再也找不到他丢失的那只手了
could never find his missing hand."

1177
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:36,330
它变成了石头 他的财富消失了
"It turned to stone, his fortune gone,

1178
01:39:36,410 --> 01:39:40,000
他的骄傲 他的土地 都失去了”
and he lost his pride and lost his land."

1179
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:48,200
非常好 宝贝
Very good, my dear.

1180
01:39:48,290 --> 01:39:51,200
读得真棒 再读下这个吧
Beautifully read. Now try this one.

1181
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:02,250
狼来了
Wolves.

1182
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:48,700
某个想法
An idea,

1183
01:40:49,830 --> 01:40:52,120
某种感觉 在我心中愈发清晰
a feeling became clear to me.

1184
01:40:54,910 --> 01:40:57,450
猎人并不憎恨狼
The hunter did not hate the wolf.

1185
01:40:58,330 --> 01:41:00,700
狼并不憎恨羊
The wolf did not hate the sheep.

1186
01:41:06,410 --> 01:41:09,330
但相互之间的暴力冲突无可避免
But violence felt inevitable between them.

1187
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:15,540
我想 也许这正是世界的法则
Perhaps, I thought, this was the way of the world.

1188
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:19,790
你成为猎物 被杀
It would hunt you and kill you

1189
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:23,370
只是因为你的身份
just for being who you are.

1190
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:28,410
父亲 我月末就会把羊卖掉
The sheep will be sold by the end of the month, Father.

1191
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:31,910
然后带着你 阿尔玛和安娜玛丽亚去镇上住
Then I'll take you, Alma and Anna-Maria into town.

1192
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:33,870
我们要上山
We'll go into the mountains,

1193
01:41:33,950 --> 01:41:36,000
去猎几头狼 冬末回来
hunt the wolves and be back at the end of winter.

1194
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:41,040
我每年冬天都在这里祈祷 今年也一样
I pray here alone every winter and this year will be no different.

1195
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:43,750
父亲 求你了 听劝吧
Please, Father, listen to reason.

1196
01:41:43,830 --> 01:41:47,330
你们该怎么做就怎么做 我也一样
You do what you must and so will I.

1197
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:52,620
老顽固
You stubborn old goat.

1198
01:41:55,250 --> 01:41:57,620
现在只有你和我了 森林精灵
It's just you and I now, Spirit.

1199
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:00,000
就你和我了
Just you and I.

1200
01:42:00,580 --> 01:42:05,200
我已经构想了无数种方式
And I had formed in my imagination many ways

1201
01:42:05,290 --> 01:42:07,950
我要在这个老头面前现身
I would present myself to the old man.

1202
01:42:09,620 --> 01:42:11,000
他会怕我？
Would he fear me?

1203
01:42:12,410 --> 01:42:13,580
欢迎我？
Welcome me?

1204
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,250
还是会赶我走呢？
Turn me away?

1205
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:24,580
谁在那里？
Who goes there?

1206
01:42:30,910 --> 01:42:35,160
上前一步 我进入了完全不同的世界
With a single step, I entered a different world.

1207
01:42:36,370 --> 01:42:38,910
曾经我只能远远观望的世界
One I had only seen from afar.

1208
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:42,910
到底是谁？
Please, who is it?

1209
01:42:43,540 --> 01:42:44,540
出个声吧
Answer me.

1210
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:46,790
告诉我
Tell me.

1211
01:42:47,410 --> 01:42:48,910
你来干什么的？
Why are you here?

1212
01:42:51,330 --> 01:42:52,200
路过
Travel.

1213
01:42:52,790 --> 01:42:54,580
亲爱的过客 欢迎你
Welcome, dear traveler.

1214
01:42:55,620 --> 01:43:01,410
请你自己找把椅子 不要觉得我怠慢了你
Do not think me ungrateful for the company if I ask you to procure a chair.

1215
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:06,250
我没法周到待客
I… I find it difficult being a good host.

1216
01:43:06,330 --> 01:43:07,160
没错
Yes.

1217
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:10,830
我的眼睛看不见
My… My sight has failed me.

1218
01:43:12,660 --> 01:43:16,660
桌上有面包和白兰地
But there is bread and brandy on the table.

1219
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:17,870
请自行享用
Pray help yourself.

1220
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:21,540
白兰地？
Bran… dy?

1221
01:43:22,870 --> 01:43:24,330
听你说话
Your language.

1222
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:28,330
好像不大流利
You have a hard time speaking it.

1223
01:43:28,910 --> 01:43:31,000
你是不是从别的地方来的？
Are you not from these parts?

1224
01:43:36,790 --> 01:43:37,660
你害怕吗？
Are you afraid?

1225
01:43:39,620 --> 01:43:40,870
不用怕
No need to be.

1226
01:43:45,870 --> 01:43:47,500
你在怕什么？
What are you afraid of?

1227
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:49,290
什么都怕
-Everything.

1228
01:43:49,370 --> 01:43:50,200
你的…
-Your…

1229
01:43:50,790 --> 01:43:53,250
你的手好冷
Your hands are frozen

1230
01:43:53,790 --> 01:43:57,450
你还受伤了
and you've been hurt, have you not?

1231
01:43:57,540 --> 01:43:58,410
受伤？
Hurt?

1232
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:05,250
没错 你的手上和脸上都有伤疤
Yes. Your hands and face have scars

1233
01:44:05,330 --> 01:44:06,950
你还穿着制服
and you are wearing uniform.

1234
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:08,870
是在战斗中受的伤吗？
Were you injured in battle?

1235
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:12,950
你一直
You were hiding

1236
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:16,500
躲在磨坊齿轮里面 对吧？
in the mill gears, were you not?

1237
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:24,250
对 你就是森林精灵
Yeah. Yeah. The Spirit of the Forest.

1238
01:44:24,330 --> 01:44:25,160
没错
Yes.

1239
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:28,500
我看不到你的面容
I cannot judge of your countenance,

1240
01:44:29,330 --> 01:44:31,660
但听你的嗓音
but there is something in your voice

1241
01:44:31,750 --> 01:44:35,620
你肯定很善良
which persuades me of your goodwill and kindness.

1242
01:44:36,120 --> 01:44:37,200
善良？
-Kindness? -Mm.

1243
01:44:39,620 --> 01:44:41,700
留下来吧
Stay with me.

1244
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:45,620
你可以吃我的东西 烤我的火
Share my food and fire.

1245
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:50,000
我有的不多 但能跟你分享 我会很高兴的
I would be delighted to share what little I have with you

1246
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:53,660
有你陪着我 对我也大有好处
and would be greatly helped by your companionship.

1247
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:57,450
你可以读书给我听
And you… you could read to me.

1248
01:44:57,950 --> 01:44:58,870
读书？
-Read? -Mm.

1249
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:05,870
把这里当成自己家 把我当成朋友
Make this your home and I your friend.

1250
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:08,370
朋友
Friend.

1251
01:45:13,750 --> 01:45:14,750
朋友
Friend.

1252
01:45:23,330 --> 01:45:24,160
朋友
Friends.

1253
01:45:25,580 --> 01:45:29,620
就是在那时 我读到了我生命中第一个故事
And it was then that I read my first story,

1254
01:45:30,620 --> 01:45:33,160
也是《圣经》中的第一个故事
and it was the first story.

1255
01:45:34,370 --> 01:45:39,330
故事的主人公是一个名叫亚当的男子 和名叫夏娃的女子
I read about a man named Adam and a woman named Eve,

1256
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:43,580
他们住在人类的第一个乐园里
about their time in the first garden.

1257
01:45:44,450 --> 01:45:47,660
我读到了两座城市崛起 相互竞争
I read about the rise of rival cities

1258
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:49,910
一座高塔倒塌
and the collapse of a tower

1259
01:45:50,410 --> 01:45:52,750
上帝震怒毁城
and the wrath of a God.

1260
01:45:53,330 --> 01:45:57,750
我读到人类斗巨龙
And I read about men that fought dragons

1261
01:45:57,830 --> 01:46:00,500
最终失去一切
and men who lost everything.

1262
01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:03,040
时光流逝
And time passed

1263
01:46:03,620 --> 01:46:06,870
如秋叶飘落
and fell away with the leaves of autumn.

1264
01:46:18,540 --> 01:46:21,660
亲爱的朋友 你见过下雪吗？
Have you never seen the snow, my dear friend?

1265
01:46:23,330 --> 01:46:27,080
大雪荡涤一切 让世界焕然一新
It makes the world clean… and new.

1266
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:37,830
“吾乃奥兹曼迪亚斯 万王之王
"My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings."

1267
01:46:38,330 --> 01:46:41,660
盖世功业 敢叫天公折服
"Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair."

1268
01:46:42,950 --> 01:46:45,200
此外无一物
"No thing beside remains."

1269
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:50,080
但见废墟周围 寂寞平沙空莽莽
"Round the decay of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare."

1270
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:53,870
伸向荒凉的四方
"The lone and level sands stretch far away."

1271
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:58,450
吾乃奥兹曼迪亚斯”
"My name is Ozymandias…"

1272
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:07,700
世上哪里的书比这里还多？
Are there more books than this in the world?

1273
01:47:09,750 --> 01:47:11,620
肯定还有一些地方
A few more, I'm sure.

1274
01:47:12,370 --> 01:47:13,790
不是这里
Not here.

1275
01:47:15,830 --> 01:47:19,250
左边最后 就拿那本
Last book on the left. Take it.

1276
01:47:19,330 --> 01:47:21,370
那本还没读过
We haven't got to it.

1277
01:47:21,450 --> 01:47:24,200
弥尔顿的《失乐园》
Paradise Lost, Milton.

1278
01:47:24,290 --> 01:47:27,200
人类对上帝有疑问
Man has questions for God.

1279
01:47:27,950 --> 01:47:30,330
就连上帝自己也有疑问
Even God has questions.

1280
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:35,750
我觉得上帝也想得到答案 所以才会派来自己的儿子
I think he wanted answers and that is why he sent us his son.

1281
01:47:36,330 --> 01:47:38,790
或许他很想了解死亡
Death probably intrigued him.

1282
01:47:39,410 --> 01:47:40,290
了解受苦受难
Suffering.

1283
01:47:41,450 --> 01:47:44,410
我想知道我是谁
I want to know who I am.

1284
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:46,910
我从哪里来？
Where do I come from?

1285
01:47:47,450 --> 01:47:52,750
上帝拿走了你的记忆 而我多么希望我的记忆也被带走
God took your memory just as I wish he would take mine away.

1286
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:57,500
多年前 我拿走了某个人的生命
Many years ago, I took a man's life.

1287
01:47:58,160 --> 01:47:59,080
那是个好人
A good man.

1288
01:47:59,620 --> 01:48:02,040
自那时起 我一直在赎罪
And I have been atoning for it since.

1289
01:48:04,330 --> 01:48:05,200
试着原谅
Forgive.

1290
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:06,950
试着忘记
Forget.

1291
01:48:07,660 --> 01:48:09,580
智慧真正的试金石
The true measure of wisdom.

1292
01:48:10,790 --> 01:48:12,910
是知道自己受了伤害
To know you have been harmed,

1293
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,160
知道被谁伤害
by whom you have been harmed,

1294
01:48:15,250 --> 01:48:18,120
然后选择让一切烟消云散
and choose to let it all fade.

1295
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:23,160
但记不起来的东西 要怎么忘记
But I cannot forget what I cannot remember.

1296
01:48:23,250 --> 01:48:24,660
你什么都记不起来吗？
Do you recall nothing?

1297
01:48:30,120 --> 01:48:32,830
在睡梦中
In my dreams…

1298
01:48:35,620 --> 01:48:38,870
我…能窥见记忆
…I… see memories.

1299
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:43,750
各种各样的人
Different men.

1300
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:48,790
都是…一些片断
All… pieces.

1301
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,000
我…
I…

1302
01:48:59,330 --> 01:49:03,080
我记得有火 有水
I remember f… fire and water.

1303
01:49:06,250 --> 01:49:08,160
脚下有沙子
And sand under my feet.

1304
01:49:15,330 --> 01:49:16,580
还有一个词
And a word.

1305
01:49:19,250 --> 01:49:20,750
就一个词
A single word.

1306
01:49:23,200 --> 01:49:24,500
什么词？
What is it?

1307
01:49:27,290 --> 01:49:28,290
维克多
Victor.

1308
01:49:29,580 --> 01:49:30,750
去找到它
Go to it.

1309
01:49:31,790 --> 01:49:32,910
维克多
The word.

1310
01:50:09,750 --> 01:50:11,790
然后我终于体会到了
And then I learned it.

1311
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:14,910
真相的可怖
The horror of the truth.

1312
01:50:20,700 --> 01:50:23,870
我明白了 自己一无是处
I understood that I was nothing.

1313
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:26,370
是个可怜虫
A wretch.

1314
01:50:27,080 --> 01:50:28,370
是块不起眼的污渍
A blot.

1315
01:50:28,910 --> 01:50:32,040
甚至算不上是人类
Not even of the same nature as man.

1316
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:37,040
这种痛苦缠绕着我
This hurt clung to my mind.

1317
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:41,450
永不消散
It never let go.

1318
01:51:24,870 --> 01:51:26,450
然后我看见了
Then I saw it.

1319
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:29,450
你的名字
Your name.

1320
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:33,700
“维克多·弗兰肯斯坦”
"Victor Frankenstein."

1321
01:51:33,790 --> 01:51:35,750
知道了到哪里能找到你
And where to find you.

1322
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,250
不！
No!

1323
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:01,250
不！
No!

1324
01:53:10,290 --> 01:53:11,700
你回来了
You came back.

1325
01:53:11,790 --> 01:53:14,080
我知道我是谁了
I found what I am.

1326
01:53:18,290 --> 01:53:20,700
知道我是什么造就的了
What I am made from.

1327
01:53:23,410 --> 01:53:28,040
我…我是尸骨堆里造出来的
I am… the child of a charnel house.

1328
01:53:31,330 --> 01:53:32,660
我是残骸
A wreckage.

1329
01:53:33,910 --> 01:53:37,200
是用垃圾和被丢弃的尸体拼凑出来的
Assembled from refuse and the discarded dead.

1330
01:53:43,910 --> 01:53:45,120
是怪物
A monster.

1331
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:49,000
我知道你是谁
I know what you are.

1332
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:52,330
你是个好人
A good man.

1333
01:53:53,200 --> 01:53:57,700
也是我的朋友
And… you are my friend.

1334
01:54:07,450 --> 01:54:08,620
朋友？
Friend?

1335
01:54:10,580 --> 01:54:11,750
朋友
Friend.

1336
01:54:14,830 --> 01:54:16,120
那是什么？
What is that thing?

1337
01:54:17,790 --> 01:54:19,660
是森林里的那东西吗？
The-- The thing from the woods?

1338
01:54:20,910 --> 01:54:22,000
你把他怎么了？
What have you done to him?

1339
01:54:24,330 --> 01:54:25,290
别动
Don't move.

1340
01:54:36,580 --> 01:54:38,910
快！上膛！杀了它！
Quick! Reload! Kill it!

1341
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,040
一切重回寂静
There was silence again,

1342
01:55:56,330 --> 01:56:01,450
而冷酷无情的生活还将继续
and then… merciless life.

1343
01:56:16,870 --> 01:56:18,790
我死了多久？
How long did I die for?

1344
01:56:19,370 --> 01:56:20,660
不知道
I do not know.

1345
01:56:21,370 --> 01:56:23,660
但我看到身上的伤口愈合了
But I saw my injuries healed.

1346
01:56:24,750 --> 01:56:28,370
冬日的寒风直灌入肺
The cold winter air stung in my lungs.

1347
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:39,620
孤独感更甚以往 且前所未有
I felt lonelier than ever,

1348
01:56:40,620 --> 01:56:45,450
因为对世人而言 治愈一切痛苦的良药
because for every man there was but one remedy to all pain:

1349
01:56:46,540 --> 01:56:51,160
唯有死亡 而这恩赐你也狠心剥夺
Death, a gift you too had denied me.

1350
01:56:52,040 --> 01:56:54,160
我的内心涌起羡慕之情
Envy rose within me

1351
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:58,080
遂决意向你索求一份恩典
and decided to demand a single grace from you.

1352
01:56:59,330 --> 01:57:01,040
我的缔造者
My creator.

1353
01:57:02,370 --> 01:57:06,830
我想要…一个同伴
I would demand… a companion.

1354
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:34,950
起来吧
I need you to get up.

1355
01:57:36,290 --> 01:57:37,830
好的
Yes, of course. Of course.

1356
01:57:37,910 --> 01:57:40,700
婚礼马上要开始了 你得陪在我身边
The wedding will start soon and I want you by my side.

1357
01:57:41,410 --> 01:57:42,700
要不是你天性善良
It's hard to believe,

1358
01:57:43,750 --> 01:57:45,750
我都不敢相信这话是你说的
if not for your kind nature.

1359
01:58:00,830 --> 01:58:03,200
我跟几位宾客说了调查的事
I've spoken to a few guests about the inquest.

1360
01:58:04,120 --> 01:58:05,200
关于那场爆炸的调查
About the explosion.

1361
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,160
他们中的大多数都接受了官方的说法
The majority accept it for what it was.

1362
01:58:11,450 --> 01:58:13,450
官方怎么说 威廉？
And what was it, William?

1363
01:58:14,870 --> 01:58:15,950
都过去了 维克多
The past, Victor.

1364
01:58:17,620 --> 01:58:18,910
那是场可怕的意外
A terrible accident.

1365
01:58:26,290 --> 01:58:28,080
我想卖了那座庄园
I intend to sell the estate.

1366
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:33,540
我们只有彼此了
All we have is each other.

1367
01:58:49,250 --> 01:58:51,160
往四面八方撒
I want you to throw the petals everywhere.

1368
01:58:51,250 --> 01:58:52,660
到处都撒一点
Throw them everywhere.

1369
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:56,950
到楼上去 再多撒点
Go upstairs and do some more of that.

1370
01:59:06,370 --> 01:59:09,830
我知道 婚礼前见新娘会带来厄运
I know it is bad luck to see the bride before the ceremony.

1371
01:59:10,450 --> 01:59:11,660
只对新郎起效
Only for the groom.

1372
01:59:13,410 --> 01:59:14,950
没错 对我没用
Yes, that's right. Not for me.

1373
01:59:17,160 --> 01:59:18,370
你好啊 伊丽莎白
Hello, Elizabeth.

1374
01:59:21,290 --> 01:59:24,790
之前我从未感受过懊悔 而现在懊悔充斥了我的内心
I've rarely felt remorse before and now I feel little else. I…

1375
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:29,660
我的心被一种冲动占据已久 但这种感觉已经消散
A fever gripped me for so long, but it has passed,

1376
01:59:29,750 --> 01:59:31,750
我可以正常地面对你了
and I see you now as I should.

1377
01:59:33,450 --> 01:59:37,620
无论如何 我衷心祝愿
For whatever it's worth, I… I wish you and my little brother,

1378
01:59:37,700 --> 01:59:40,410
你和我挚爱的弟弟幸福
who I love more than life, the very best.

1379
01:59:43,160 --> 01:59:45,120
你大可以自欺欺人
You may like to believe you do.

1380
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:51,040
而我都害怕听见
And I dread to even hear it.

1381
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:57,910
今天是我的大喜之日 我就求你一件事
On my wedding day, I ask you but for a single grace.

1382
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:00,370
别撒谎了
No more lies.

1383
02:00:01,790 --> 02:00:04,000
-我想告诉你… -给我出去
-I-- I want to tell you-- -Leave my chambers now.

1384
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:05,870
-伊丽莎白 -出去！
-Elizabeth. -Leave!

1385
02:01:00,080 --> 02:01:01,870
出来 别躲在暗处
Come out of the shadows,

1386
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:04,450
如果你在这里
if you are here.

1387
02:01:21,910 --> 02:01:23,160
你是来感谢我的吗？
Are you here to thank me?

1388
02:01:23,750 --> 02:01:27,290
你活下来了 还变得足够聪明 都找到我了
You survived and are intelligent enough to have found me.

1389
02:01:29,290 --> 02:01:30,700
是我造得好
I made you well.

1390
02:01:30,790 --> 02:01:37,450
我要你给我造一个同伴
I need you to make a companion for me.

1391
02:01:38,160 --> 02:01:40,200
像我这样的
One like me.

1392
02:01:40,290 --> 02:01:42,000
同伴？
A com… A companion?

1393
02:01:48,040 --> 02:01:49,040
我知道了
I see.

1394
02:01:53,330 --> 02:01:54,660
再来个怪物
Another monster.

1395
02:01:55,330 --> 02:01:56,330
对
Yes.

1396
02:01:57,200 --> 02:01:59,370
让我们两个怪物作伴
We can be monsters together.

1397
02:02:02,580 --> 02:02:07,040
我付出巨大代价 才找回了理智
I have found sanity at such a cost,

1398
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:11,500
你却想让我再回疯狂
and you here… are madness calling me back.

1399
02:02:11,580 --> 02:02:13,620
我死不了
I cannot die.

1400
02:02:17,250 --> 02:02:19,290
只有我自己
And I cannot live…

1401
02:02:21,910 --> 02:02:22,910
我也活不好
alone.

1402
02:02:24,160 --> 02:02:26,700
我造出了非常恐怖的东西
In you I have created something truly horrible.

1403
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:29,950
不是东西
Not something.

1404
02:02:30,910 --> 02:02:32,660
是人
Someone.

1405
02:02:33,660 --> 02:02:36,830
你造出了人
You made someone.

1406
02:02:37,620 --> 02:02:38,540
就是我
Me.

1407
02:02:39,450 --> 02:02:42,250
不管我多么让人费解 但我会思考
Whatever puzzle I am, creator, I think.

1408
02:02:43,160 --> 02:02:44,410
有感受
I feel.

1409
02:02:45,870 --> 02:02:47,580
我只有这一个请求
I have this sole petition…

1410
02:02:48,450 --> 02:02:52,540
再造一个像我一样的
Make one like me.

1411
02:02:54,290 --> 02:02:55,410
然后呢？
And then what?

1412
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:58,200
生育
Procreation.

1413
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,620
繁殖
Reproduction.

1414
02:03:06,450 --> 02:03:07,620
建立家庭？
A home?

1415
02:03:08,540 --> 02:03:09,950
建造坟墓？
A grave?

1416
02:03:11,540 --> 02:03:15,250
死亡与破坏不断上演
Death begetting death begetting death.

1417
02:03:15,330 --> 02:03:17,580
恶魔的种族在地球上蔓延
A race of devils propagated upon the earth.

1418
02:03:17,660 --> 02:03:19,620
肮脏永不断绝
Obscenity perpetuating itself.

1419
02:03:20,410 --> 02:03:23,910
在你看来我很肮脏 在我看来我只是我
I am obscene to you, but to myself I simply am.

1420
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,160
滚开！
Begone!

1421
02:03:27,620 --> 02:03:33,830
我绝不会再造一个 像你这么邪恶丑陋的东西
Never again will I make something like you, wicked and deformed.

1422
02:03:38,290 --> 02:03:44,330
这一切还不都是 源自你的执念 维克多
Then it is still all about your will, Victor.

1423
02:03:47,080 --> 02:03:52,410
凭恐怖的执念造就我 如今又固执地谴责我
That horrible, horrible will that birthed me condemns me now?

1424
02:03:53,700 --> 02:03:58,330
我开口说话算不上奇迹 你愿意倾听才算！
The miracle is not that I should speak, but that you would ever listen!

1425
02:04:02,080 --> 02:04:07,330
你不愿赐我伴侣 我将倾泻怒火
If you are not to award me love, then I will indulge in rage.

1426
02:04:07,410 --> 02:04:08,950
无穷无尽的怒火
And mine is infinite.

1427
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:16,500
请让一让
Step aside.

1428
02:04:16,580 --> 02:04:17,500
维克多
Victor.

1429
02:04:18,870 --> 02:04:19,910
怎么了？
What's going on?

1430
02:04:38,660 --> 02:04:39,700
你
You…

1431
02:04:44,620 --> 02:04:45,500
你
You…

1432
02:04:46,660 --> 02:04:47,580
是你
It's you.

1433
02:04:52,870 --> 02:04:55,000
伊丽莎白 离它远一点！
Elizabeth, move away from it!

1434
02:04:55,700 --> 02:04:56,620
不要！
No!

1435
02:05:10,660 --> 02:05:13,500
那东西袭击了她！
It attacked her! It attacked her!

1436
02:05:32,950 --> 02:05:34,290
带我走吧
Take me with you.

1437
02:05:48,830 --> 02:05:49,910
天啊
Oh, my God!

1438
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:18,500
别动 让我来…我能救你
No, let me… I can save you.

1439
02:06:18,580 --> 02:06:19,660
我会救活你
I can save you.

1440
02:06:20,330 --> 02:06:21,330
救我？
From what?

1441
02:06:22,410 --> 02:06:23,540
是害我吧
From you?

1442
02:06:25,330 --> 02:06:26,700
我怕你 维克多
I fear you, Victor.

1443
02:06:26,790 --> 02:06:27,910
不
No, no…

1444
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:29,290
一直怕你
I always have.

1445
02:06:29,950 --> 02:06:32,410
你的每一次疯狂和破坏
Every ounce of madness and destruction.

1446
02:06:33,580 --> 02:06:37,160
如同大火 足以吞噬一切
The very conflagration that devoured everything.

1447
02:06:39,080 --> 02:06:40,450
一切都是你造成的
It all came from you.

1448
02:06:46,450 --> 02:06:47,950
你才是怪物
You are the monster.

1449
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:23,200
我和这个世界格格不入
My place was never in this world.

1450
02:07:25,120 --> 02:07:29,450
我一直渴望并追寻着 一种说不清道不明的东西
I sought and longed for something I could not quite name.

1451
02:07:31,580 --> 02:07:33,450
可在你身上 我找到了这种东西
But in you, I found it.

1452
02:07:36,750 --> 02:07:39,200
丢失并被寻回
To be lost and to be found,

1453
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:42,200
这就是爱的宿命
that is the lifespan of love.

1454
02:07:44,200 --> 02:07:45,620
其短暂
And in its brevity,

1455
02:07:46,870 --> 02:07:48,120
其悲剧性
its tragedy…

1456
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:53,870
造就永恒
this has been made eternal.

1457
02:07:57,830 --> 02:08:00,870
就让我在你的注视之中
Better this way… to fade…

1458
02:08:03,290 --> 02:08:05,160
死去吧
with your eyes gazing upon me.

1459
02:08:48,200 --> 02:08:51,290
她走了 我也想随她而去
She is gone and I long to follow.

1460
02:08:56,120 --> 02:08:58,250
你给了我备受唾弃的生命
You gave me life unwanted.

1461
02:08:59,580 --> 02:09:01,410
我这就还给你
I give that back to you.

1462
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:04,120
你当我是怪物
You thought me a monster.

1463
02:09:04,950 --> 02:09:06,580
就让我这个怪物来回敬你
Now I return the favor.

1464
02:09:12,370 --> 02:09:15,160
杀了我 现在就杀了我
Kill me! Kill me now, do it!

1465
02:09:16,410 --> 02:09:18,160
我要让你流血
I will make you bleed.

1466
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,120
让你卑微求饶
I will make you humble.

1467
02:09:21,870 --> 02:09:23,540
你是造了我
You may be my creator,

1468
02:09:24,120 --> 02:09:27,950
但从今天起 你要听我的话
but from this day forward, I will be your master.

1469
02:10:08,040 --> 02:10:12,120
你为了猎杀我
You hunted me past the forests,

1470
02:10:12,950 --> 02:10:14,830
翻山越岭
past the mountains,

1471
02:10:15,540 --> 02:10:17,950
横跨冰川
past frozen horizons,

1472
02:10:19,080 --> 02:10:22,000
直到天地间
until there was nothing left.

1473
02:10:22,580 --> 02:10:25,620
只剩你我
Just you… and me.

1474
02:10:46,120 --> 02:10:47,040
给我来点子弹
I need ammunition.

1475
02:10:50,290 --> 02:10:51,700
这个磨快一点
Sharpen this.

1476
02:10:51,790 --> 02:10:54,160
来三罐炼乳 一点木柴
Three cans of condensed milk, some firewood.

1477
02:10:56,040 --> 02:10:57,500
还有六筒炸药
And six sticks of dynamite.

1478
02:10:57,580 --> 02:10:58,410
六筒？
Six?

1479
02:10:59,370 --> 02:11:00,620
你要打什么？
What are you hunting?

1480
02:11:02,250 --> 02:11:03,500
大的
Big game.

1481
02:12:11,500 --> 02:12:13,450
不！
No! No! No!

1482
02:12:22,330 --> 02:12:24,040
维克多
Victor.

1483
02:12:24,120 --> 02:12:27,160
只有被我伤到 你才会听我说话
You only listen when I hurt you.

1484
02:12:41,330 --> 02:12:44,870
这个 你相信这东西
This. You put your faith in this.

1485
02:12:44,950 --> 02:12:47,250
能够摧毁我
You think this will unmake me.

1486
02:12:51,700 --> 02:12:55,000
点着吧 希望如你所愿 但如果失败了
Light it then and hope it does, but if it does not,

1487
02:12:55,080 --> 02:12:57,160
我会再来找你
I will come for you again.

1488
02:12:57,790 --> 02:12:59,120
点起来！
Light it!

1489
02:13:06,700 --> 02:13:10,040
快跑吧
Now… run.

1490
02:13:47,120 --> 02:13:52,660
好了 如今你残破不堪
So, there you were, broken and discarded.

1491
02:13:53,750 --> 02:13:55,120
而我
And I,

1492
02:13:56,450 --> 02:13:58,250
又活过来了
alive again.

1493
02:14:03,040 --> 02:14:07,950
我能感到 被灼伤的血肉在重新生长
I could feel my singed flesh regrowing.

1494
02:14:08,790 --> 02:14:12,660
断裂的骨头重回原位
The crackling of my bones resetting.

1495
02:14:13,910 --> 02:14:20,250
永不停息的心脏泵出汩汩的血流
The murmur of my blood pumping through my incessant heart.

1496
02:14:21,370 --> 02:14:24,330
再次发现无人怜悯
And once more finding no mercy,

1497
02:14:25,830 --> 02:14:28,290
我只剩一条路可走
I had but one path.

1498
02:14:40,450 --> 02:14:42,200
我们终究走到了这一步
And here we are.

1499
02:14:44,620 --> 02:14:46,540
精疲力尽 一无所有
Spent and done.

1500
02:14:49,330 --> 02:14:52,660
再没有什么可以付出或索取了
No more in us to give or take.

1501
02:14:53,200 --> 02:14:54,620
帐篷外的血迹
The blood outside the tent…

1502
02:14:55,120 --> 02:14:56,160
是我的
It is mine.

1503
02:14:57,330 --> 02:14:58,790
都是我的
All mine.

1504
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,290
我将流血
I will bleed.

1505
02:15:02,830 --> 02:15:03,700
疼痛
Ache.

1506
02:15:04,870 --> 02:15:06,000
受苦
Suffer.

1507
02:15:09,120 --> 02:15:11,950
永无尽头
You see, it will never end.

1508
02:15:31,910 --> 02:15:33,450
对不起
I am sorry.

1509
02:15:39,950 --> 02:15:42,000
我的内心充满懊悔
Regret consumes me.

1510
02:15:44,120 --> 02:15:46,660
如今我终于能正视我的生命了
And I now regard my life for what it was.

1511
02:15:49,160 --> 02:15:51,580
缔造者 你要走了
You will go now, creator.

1512
02:15:54,410 --> 02:15:56,000
要消失了
Fade away.

1513
02:15:58,700 --> 02:16:01,370
一切都只是短暂的一瞬
It will all be but a brief moment.

1514
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:06,000
我的诞生 我的悲伤
My birth. My grief.

1515
02:16:06,910 --> 02:16:08,370
你的损失
Your loss.

1516
02:16:10,950 --> 02:16:13,200
我不会受惩罚
I will not be punished.

1517
02:16:14,660 --> 02:16:16,410
也无法摆脱罪责
Nor absolved.

1518
02:16:20,830 --> 02:16:22,160
我的希望
What hope I had,

1519
02:16:23,200 --> 02:16:24,750
我的怒火
what rage…

1520
02:16:26,540 --> 02:16:27,910
都毫无意义
It is all nothing.

1521
02:16:31,200 --> 02:16:35,660
那股造就我的浪潮 如今要带你走了
The tide that brought me here now comes to take you away.

1522
02:16:38,160 --> 02:16:39,500
留下搁浅的我
Leaving me stranded.

1523
02:16:47,790 --> 02:16:49,250
原谅我吧
Forgive me.

1524
02:16:51,250 --> 02:16:52,500
吾儿
My son.

1525
02:17:00,750 --> 02:17:05,410
如你有意 也请宽恕自己的存在
And if you have it in your heart, forgive yourself into existence.

1526
02:17:06,040 --> 02:17:10,410
吾儿 如果无法死去 还请细思此事
If death is not to be, then consider this, my son.

1527
02:17:11,080 --> 02:17:12,790
既然活着
While you are alive,

1528
02:17:13,660 --> 02:17:16,450
除了活下去 还有别的选择吗？
what recourse do you have but to live?

1529
02:17:23,870 --> 02:17:24,950
活着
Live.

1530
02:17:26,620 --> 02:17:27,870
说出我的名字吧
Say my name.

1531
02:17:29,700 --> 02:17:31,950
我的名字是父亲起的
My father gave me that name,

1532
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:34,410
但其实并无意义
and it meant nothing.

1533
02:17:36,950 --> 02:17:39,250
现在 我请求你把这个名字还给我
Now I ask you to give it back to me…

1534
02:17:41,750 --> 02:17:43,120
最后一次了
one last time.

1535
02:17:44,950 --> 02:17:46,700
就像最开始 你把这个名字
The way you said it at the beginning.

1536
02:17:48,290 --> 02:17:50,580
当成全世界时那样呼唤我
When it meant the world to you.

1537
02:17:56,290 --> 02:17:57,500
维克多
Victor.

1538
02:18:00,500 --> 02:18:02,000
我宽恕你
I forgive you.

1539
02:18:25,080 --> 02:18:27,660
安息吧 父亲
Rest now, Father.

1540
02:18:32,160 --> 02:18:33,540
或许现在
Perhaps now,

1541
02:18:35,450 --> 02:18:37,540
我们都能算作是人了
we can both be human.

1542
02:18:47,370 --> 02:18:48,290
放下武器
Weapons down.

1543
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,040
-放下武器 -我要为我的人负责
-Put the weapons down! -I am responsible for my men.

1544
02:18:52,450 --> 02:18:53,700
让他走
He can leave.

1545
02:20:28,580 --> 02:20:29,660
船能动了！
We are free!

1546
02:20:29,750 --> 02:20:31,000
我们自由了！
We are free!

1547
02:20:32,500 --> 02:20:33,790
船长
